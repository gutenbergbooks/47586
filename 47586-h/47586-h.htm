<h2 style="page-break-before: avoid;">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="centre">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;◇&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="figleft101" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/i_008b.jpg" width="101" height="450" alt="" /></span><span class="hidden">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> very favourable reception accorded both by
Press and Public to the "Circle of the Year,"
has induced me to prepare a second volume,
similar in design, but dealing with different branches
of the same subject. As the former was founded on
the <em>first</em> series of a popular French work, "Les
Saisons," by M. Hoefer, so the present has been
suggested by the <em>second</em> series; but in availing myself
of it, I have omitted much, I have revised more, and
at various parts my additions have been considerable.
And here, as in my former effort, I have written from
a popular rather than a scientific point of view. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
not been my object to sketch the outlines or lay down
the foundations of any science; but to show, as best I could,
how much of wonder and beauty enters into our daily life, and
what inexhaustible sources of study lie at our very feet. It is,
perhaps, a misfortune of our common systems of education
that they too much neglect the tuition of the eye; that the
young are not taught to mark the curious and interesting
objects which are comprehended within their daily vision;
that they know so much about ancient mythology and so little
about modern science,&mdash;so much about gods and heroes, so
little about stars and flowers.</p>

<p>I have called this volume "Everyday Objects," not because
those which it describes may be seen every day, but
because they mostly belong to the region of the commonplace
and familiar; and I have called it "Picturesque Aspects
of Natural History," because I have endeavoured, in companionship
with my French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">collaborateur</i>, to indicate the
poetical side of the various sciences into which I have presumed
to penetrate. If it should awaken a love of nature in
any breast, or develop a spirit of inquiry, which may lead
the student further and further on the path of knowledge, the
labour bestowed upon these pages will not have been in vain.</p>

<p>The instinct of curiosity,&mdash;says M. Hoefer, in his preface to
the first series of "Les Saisons,"&mdash;is the awakening of the
intellectual life: it commences with the lisping of the child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
accompanies the adult in every phase of his existence, and, far
from becoming extinct with the last throb of the heart, revives
before the unknown shadows of the grave. What, then, is
there in the whole world of greater importance to follow and
direct than the movements and impulses of this curiosity, of
these uncertain pulsations of the soul? In this lies the secret
of all education; and upon education depends the future of
humanity.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he continues, the methods hitherto employed
have been absolutely insufficient. And the insufficiency is
most notable as regards the imperfect and defective training
given to the instinct of curiosity. Observe the child. Of
everything which excites his attention, he never fails to ask
you the <em>reason why</em>. It is thus that he enters into the connexion
of "cause" and "effect." It is a sign. But instead
of following up this natural indication, and developing the
thought by the exercise of the reason, we proceed as if the
being under our charge were incapable of reason; we overload
the memory of the child with a multitude of words,
whose value he cannot understand until later in life, and
perhaps never. The true direction of the mind is to proceed
from the thought to the word, and not from the word
to the thought. It is for want of having recognised and
applied this principle that our educational systems have
failed so utterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us take, for example, the study of nature. No science,
assuredly, ought to prove more attractive to the mind than
natural history. Yet mark how repulsive zoology, botany,
and mineralogy are made at the very outset, by the dryness
of their nomenclatures and the dreariness of their
classifications. Undoubtedly, it is necessary to lay down a
course of study in the midst of the marvels which everywhere
surround us; undoubtedly names are required for
the objects which attract our notice. But are not the
methods we employ directly opposed to the end we set
before ourselves?</p>

<p>I address myself to parents and teachers; and I say to
them, Do you wish to inculcate a love of science, and
yet put into the hands of your children or pupils books
which differ as widely from the book of nature as human
brotherhood&mdash;(a fiction!)&mdash;differs from universal gravitation?
Instead of familiarising us at first with the animals and
plants within our everyday reach, you collect, under the
same irrevocable iron "form," genera and species never
intended to meet in any one particular zone, and many of
which are so rare that few persons will ever be fortunate
enough to see them except in collections and engravings.
And, curious to state, the rarest species nearly always obtain
your preferences; judging, at least, from the minute
descriptions which you consecrate to them. Monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
absurdity! You seek at a distance that which lies close
to your hands, as if the Everyday Objects above, beneath,
and around, were unworthy of the science you profess.</p>

<p>But here we must pause. Upon the principles thus laid
down by M. Hoefer, have been founded the two unpretending
companion volumes, of which the second is now submitted
to the lenient judgment of the public.</p>

<span class="hidden">O</span><span class="smcap">ur</span> observation of the celestial phenomena may
most easily be made in the winter-time. Then the nights are long,
and the vault of heaven is crowded with stars, and, unilluminated by
the moon, exhibits all its splendours. In the other seasons of the
year, and particularly in summer, the twilight gleam encroaches, so
to speak, upon a portion of the nights, which are otherwise so brief,
and precludes our vision from any exact estimate of the stars. Those
demitints, those soft subdued reflections of light, scarcely permit the
eye to distinguish even stars of the first and second magnitude, which
shine like spots of dull gold on a background of pale silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Number of the Stars.</span></p>

<p>How many are the stars?</p>

<p>To such a question comes the immediate answer, They are
infinite in number.</p>

<p>But, after a little meditation, we begin to perceive that the
question, apparently so simple, is, in reality, one of very great
complexity. Let us endeavour to disentangle its various
threads.</p>

<p>We must not forget that, in every scientific analysis, it is
important we should, in the first place, separate two intimately
united elements,&mdash;the individual who observes, and the product
of the observation. The former, the "sensorial factor,"
is subject to every condition of space and time; the second,
the "intellectual factor," tends, by its generalisations, to free
itself from those very conditions which are the inseparable
co-efficients of matter and movement. The individual passes;
save from an outer standpoint, we know not whence he
comes, nor whither he goes. The product of the observation
remains; transmissible from generation to generation, it will
gradually expand and increase, if it be founded upon truth;
but, on the contrary, its splendour will wane, and will
eventually disappear, if it be founded upon error. Eternal
is this spectacle of actors and puppets succeeding one another
uninterruptedly upon the same stage! As one falls,
another steps forward into his place, and so the great army
marches forward with unbroken ranks.</p>

<p>He who, "in cities pent," sees the sky only through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
garret window, or in the narrow intervals between house and
house, can form no accurate idea of the magnificence of
the firmament. The peasant, the shepherd, or the labourer,
spent with his daily work, prefers sleep to astronomical vigils;
and even amongst those more favoured sons of fortune, who
enjoy sufficient leisure, but few are found who feel a genuine
pleasure in the study of the stars. Though they are the
poetry of heaven, their music is inaudible to the majority of
souls. We content ourselves with an occasional careless
glance at their serene loveliness, and then turn again to the
pleasures or avocations of commonplace life.</p>

<p>But, come; let us arouse ourselves! Let us quit the city
for awhile; let us throw off all thought of its too-engrossing
pursuits; let us find time to count the stars. Gentle readers,
I ask you to follow me.</p>

<p>Ah, me! how small is the train of followers! How great my
delusion in supposing that a complete phalanx of students of
the celestial wonders would reply to my invitation!</p>

<p>We have now arrived in the open country; and here, on
the summit of this gentle ascent, crowned with a clump of
leafless trees, we pause. The sky glitters with a cold, keen
light, which is reflected back by the snowy plains. While the
eye ranges delightedly over the starry vault, the ear is struck
by the distant sound of bells, which, at the midnight hour,
ring in the infant year&mdash;ring in so many hopes and expected
joys, and unexpected sorrows&mdash;ring out so many passing pleasures
and rudely dissipated visions.</p>

</div>

<p>As the chime glides softly over the meadows, and along the
resounding vales, and through the leafless woods, repeated by
echo after echo, until its music dies away in the distance,
like our recollections of the dreams of youth, we murmur
to ourselves that solemn song of the poet, which so aptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
blends the regrets of the past with the anticipations of the
future; we exclaim&mdash;</p>

<p>The spectacle is majestic and impressive. Let us seek,
in the first place, to ascertain our position in reference to
the four points of the compass&mdash;the four cardinal points.
But how is this to be done? By day it is easy enough. I
have only to turn myself towards the sun when it has reached
the highest point of its diurnal course, and there, in front of
me, lies the south, in my rear the north, the east on my left,
and on my right the west.</p>

<p>But is it possible to ascertain one's position during the
absence of the "orb of day?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>Both possible and easy, provided the sky be clear and
cloudless.</p>

<p>But this condition is as necessary by day as by night.
How can we determine in which direction lies the south,
if the sun be hidden from our gaze by an uniformly opaque
atmosphere, and if objects, lit up by a diffuse light, project
no shadow at any time of the day?</p>

<p>Endeavour to group together the stars which more particularly
strike your gaze; and be careful, in these groupings, to
define every fantastic figure which is suggested by your
vivid imagination. Undoubtedly, our earliest ancestors, the
"world's gray forefathers," proceeded in this manner, in their
anxiety to lay hold of some definite guiding-marks in yonder
ocean of sparkling atoms. And to study a science by its
history is to follow up its successive development.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Great and the Little Bear.</span></p>

<p>Observe yonder very remarkable group of seven stars; nearly
all are of the same splendour, and they are so arranged as to figure
an antique chariot, provided with a somewhat curved axle pole.</p>

<p>Observe it carefully. And not far from this group you will
detect another, by no means so conspicuous, but exactly resembling
it in form. This second chariot is turned in an inverse
direction, and the stars composing it, with three exceptions,
are much less brilliant.</p>

<p>Here, then, are two groups of stars, clearly distinguished
by their configuration&mdash;two <em>constellations</em>, for such is the
scientific name given to all the stellar groups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 355px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;The Great Bear and Little Bear.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It has been the fortune of the first of these two groups to strike
the eye of the most indifferent observer from the remotest antiquity;
and its likeness to a <em>quadriga</em> early procured it the name of a
<em>car</em> or <em>chariot</em>. For those Christians who pleased themselves in
studding the sky with Biblical personages, it is <cite>David's Chariot</cite>.
This species of apotheosis was borrowed from the Pagans. They placed
in the skies their divinities, their demigods, their heroes, and
the principal facts and stories of their mythology. For the Greeks
and Romans the "Chariot of David" was the female of the Bear, an
ursa, or ἀρκτὸς. Whence came this
transfiguration? Listen to the fanciful old myth.</p>


<p class="p1a">Callisto was the most beautiful of the daughters of the
King Lycaon. Jupiter, who may appropriately be styled
the "Don Juan" or "Lovelace" of the heathen Olympus, fell
in love with her; and she bore him a son, named Arcas, who
gave his name to Arcadia, that land of song and fable, groves
and streams, where Lycaon exercised his sovereign sway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Juno, the queen of heaven, and wife of the so-called king of
gods and men, transported by her jealous rage, changed
Callisto into a she-bear; who, one day, would have been
unwittingly slain by Arcas, if Jupiter, opportunely appearing
on the scene, had not metamorphosed the hunter into another
animal, <em>Ursa Minor</em>, or the Little Bear. According to this
myth, the Little Bear will be but a transformation of the
former, who was the Great Bear, or, before all and above all,
<em>the</em> Bear.</p>

<p>It is somewhat surprising, according to certain writers, that
Homer should refer to only one of these constellations:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i0">(The Bear, which men the Chariot also name).</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the learned commentators who have censured the poet
for making no distinction between Ursa Major and Ursa
Minor, probably never looked at the starry vault with an
attentive eye; otherwise, like all the world, they might have
convinced themselves that the seven stars, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">septem triones</i>
(whence the word "septentrion"), forming the beautiful constellation,
which, undoubtedly, long before Homer's time, was
known as "The Bear" or "The Celestial Chariot," were all
that could be seen. With a single exception, these stars are
of the second magnitude&mdash;that is to say, they, so far as
regards their brilliancy, rank next to the most brilliant stars
of the firmament. The least conspicuous star in the group&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the third magnitude&mdash;occupies the base of the pole of
the Celestial Chariot, or of the Bear's tail; it is the fourth
star counting from the extremity of the tail. On celestial
charts, it is particularised by the fourth letter of the Greek
alphabet, δ (delta).</p>

<p>Observe, in passing, that the first of these charts, wherein the
stars of a constellation were indicated by Greek characters, appeared
in 1603, at Augsburg, under the title of "Uranometria." Its author,
Jean Bayer, an amateur astronomer, who died in 1660, conceived the idea
of designating by the first letters of the Greek alphabet&mdash;α,
β, γ, δ, and so on&mdash;the most noticeable stars. The animals bearing
the names of the constellations are drawn in this map with very
considerable care; but it requires, let us hasten to add, much
imagination and good-will to recognise, in the form of a stellar group,
the animal shown in the drawing.</p>

<p>Thus far Ursa Major. The four stars of the quadriga, or
chariot, have been employed to form the dorso-lumbar region
of the animal; the three others define its tail; and, finally,
twenty-four little stars, some of which are hardly visible to the
naked eye, compose the head and paws of the celestial "plantigrade."</p>

<p>As for Ursa Minor, it is impossible to distinguish it immediately
when you are unaccustomed to surveying or examining
the celestial vault. To detect its position, you require to be
forewarned of it; to know, in the first place, that there exists
in the vicinity of the Bear an exactly similar stellar group.
The point of the tail&mdash;&#945; in Ursa Minor&mdash;alone possesses a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
splendour comparable to that of the principal stars in Ursa
Major. But how construct a figure with one star? The four
other stars, two of which mark the anterior part of the animal's
body, and two others the tail, properly so called, are only of
the third magnitude: they are marked β, γ, δ, ε. Finally, the
stars which define the posterior portion, marked ζ and η on Bayer's
chart, are only of the fourth magnitude--in other words, are scarcely
visible. The eye, to detect them, must be wholly free from any gleam
of light.</p>

<p>Many generations passed before they succeeded in discovering
what a single individual solved during his brief career.
All Homer's contemporaries, and, prior to these, tens of
millions of mortals, had contemplated the sky, and yet none
of them had detected the difference between Ursa Major
and Ursa Minor. The distinction, therefore, is of a comparatively
recent date; probably does not date back earlier
than the sixth century before the Christian era.</p>

<p class="p1a">Let us recall ourselves, now, to the question propounded.
The first impression produced by the aspect of the sky during
a beautiful winter night is, we repeat, that the number of the
stars is infinite. This wholly spontaneous thought, which, to
some extent, imposes itself on the mind long before the reason
attempts any calculation, is, strange to say, both false and true.</p>

<p>But how can a thought be both false and true? Nothing is
easier than to explain the seeming contradiction. We shall
return to it hereafter, after we have indulged in some indispensable
digressions.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Orion.</span></p>

<p>One of the finest and loftiest flights of Longfellow's imagination
is to be found in his poem on the occultation of Orion.
He has seldom, if ever, sounded a more vigorous strain.
After alluding to that music of the spheres which Pythagoras
dreamed of, and which Shakespeare has described in a passage
of great beauty, he continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">

  <div class="i0">Sirius was rising in the east;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, slow ascending one by one,</div>
  <div class="i0">The kindling constellations shone.</div>

</div>

<p>The most ancient observer who wished, with his own eyes,
to assure himself whether the number of the stars was infinite,
must have quickly perceived that, in spite of an apparent
impossibility, it is no difficult task to complete their enumeration.
To execute this operation conveniently, however, we
must invent a process; and of all processes, the simplest, and
that which first occurs to the mind, is to group the stars by
configurations which, to a certain degree, are <em>mnemo-technical</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Such, in our belief, is the true origin&mdash;a point so often and
laboriously discussed&mdash;of the <em>asterisms</em> or <em>constellations</em>. Their
fanciful, mythological, or poetical embellishments, are of later
date.</p>

<p class="p1a">The census or enumeration of the stars, which we suppose to have
commenced during our winter nights, must at first have been limited
to the most characteristic groups, composed of the most brilliant
points. In this scientific labour the first rank would necessarily be
occupied by Arctos (or Ursa Major) and Orion. Why? Because these two
constellations attract and rivet everybody's gaze.</p>

</div>

<p>Orion is situated on the side opposite to the Great Bear. It is
the most beautiful constellation in our western sky. You may easily
recognise it by three stars, very close together, which are inscribed,
as it were, in the centre of a great trapezium of four stars, two of
which are of the first magnitude. Beneath the three first stars, called
the Three Kings, or Orion's Belt, is visible a small stellar group of
the fourth and fifth magnitude, near which, with a good average glass,
may be distinguished the largest and most remarkable of the nebulæ.</p>

<p>According to later traditions, the giant Orion, son of Tura
and Neptune, was endowed by his father with the faculty
of walking upon the sea as well as upon earth. He abandoned
himself to the fierce joys of the chase in the wooded
isle of Crete, to whose shades he had accompanied Diana
and Latona. Swollen with pride, he defied to combat all
the monsters of the universe, and was slain by a scorpion
which the earth had engendered under his feet. But, through
the intercession of Diana, a place was given to him in the
firmament opposite Scorpio.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Diurnal Movement.</span></p>

<p>Let us put aside these dreams of the world's youth, and
return to the reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Nature, transformed by the ancients into a multiple divinity,
never fails to overwhelm with surprise the observer who interrogates
her with simplicity and without any preconcerted system. And it was
thus that he who first undertook to enumerate the stars, by the help
of the constellations, made at once the greatest and most unexpected
discovery. What, in fact, was not his astonishment on seeing the
gradual displacement of objects which, at the first glance, appeared
immovable!</p>

<p>To this very natural astonishment soon succeeded, we doubt
not, a desire to analyse the phenomenon. The most beautiful
constellations of the firmament, Ursa and Orion, will have
their points of repery on the star-gemmed sphere. An attentive
study, eagerly pursued through a certain lapse of time,
would teach him that Orion rises and sets like the sun and
the moon, while the Bear, remaining perpetually above the
horizon, neither rises nor sets. Stimulated by curiosity, the
observer would afterwards assure himself that the whole of
the celestial vault revolved upon an axis, while the stars
divided into groups; remain fixed, fixed in this sense, that
they constantly maintain among themselves the same relations
of distance. The idea of a solid sphere, to which the stars
were attached like golden nails, then came quite naturally
to the human mind. Such, undoubtedly, was the origin of
the discovery of <em>diurnal movement</em>; of that general movement
which carries all the stars from west to east, to bring them
back to the same points in the course of one complete day.</p>

<p>To hear our professors of astronomy invariably repeating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
that "the spectator of the starry vault may see, every moment,
new stars rising above the horizon,&mdash;may see them mount
the sky,&mdash;halt in their upward march when they have attained
a certain elevation,&mdash;afterwards re-descend, and pass below the
horizon;"&mdash;to hear, we say, these words incessantly reproduced,
one would think that a cursory glance at the sky would suffice
to reveal the general movement, and that what is within the
ken of the first comer, should not be called a discovery.</p>

<p>But we see in this another of those illusions which blind
contemporaries as to the time-long efforts of their predecessors
to discover the very results which long ago became our common
patrimony. Unquestionably, if you have eyes, you cannot
fail to see the apparent movement of the earth and moon;
but from thence to the relation of the whole celestial sphere
is a wide interval. How many men are there who possess, on
the one hand, sufficient patience to fix their gaze only for a
couple of hours on the same point of the starry firmament;
and, on the other, sufficient intelligence to estimate the
relation of this point to a fixed point of the horizon, and to
measure, by the thought, the interval separating these two
points? Let each one ask himself.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Determination of the Cardinal Points.</span></p>

<p>However it may be, the discovery of the rotation of the
celestial system must have been rapidly brought to perfection
as it was transmitted from one generation to another. It must
soon have been recognised that this sphere is inclined in such
a manner that one of its <em>poles</em>&mdash;the <em>poles of the world</em>, which, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
reality, are simply the prolonged extremities of the axis of
terrestrial rotation&mdash;is always above the horizon, while the
other remains below. And this phenomenon would lead to
the geometrical conception of an axis of rotation of the celestial
sphere. Thus we may explain, with perfect ease, why the
Bear and the neighbouring constellations should describe
perfect circles, and the other and more distant constellations
only arcs of circles, of a greater or lesser diameter; finally,
without even looking at the sky, we can understand that some
stars there are which show themselves on the horizon, only to
disappear immediately, and others which remain completely
invisible to the inhabitants of our climates. By a singularly
fortunate coincidence, the pole, that geometrical point around
which revolve those circumpolar constellations that are continually
above our horizon, is occupied by a star "well known
to fame," and hence, on the faith of its renown, supposed by
many people to be a star of peculiar brilliancy.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It is named
the <em>Polar Star</em> (&#945; in Ursa Minor), and is between the second
and third magnitude.</p>

<p>Now if, with arms extended, we so place ourselves that our
back shall be turned to Polaris, we shall have opposite to us
the point of the arc occupied by the sun at <em>noon</em>; on our left
the east, and on our right the west. It is thus we may easily
learn our position in the absence of the orb of day.</p>

<p>The discovery of this simple mode of guidance was, nevertheless,
an epoch in history. From thence the mariner grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
bold enough to quit the coast, which he had hitherto hugged
with timorous prudence, and venture out into the open sea.
Thenceforth, the darkness disappeared; new countries were
revealed to one another, and nations, which from time immemorial
had remained apart, were brought into frequent communication.</p>

<p>It was with eyes fixed upon the Bear, which alone does not
bathe itself in the waters of Ocean, that Ulysses set out from
Calypso's enchanted island.</p>

<p>According to Homer, who reflects in his immortal work the
condition of scientific knowledge among his contemporaries,
the ocean was a great broad river, surrounding the earth with
circumfluent volume, and in its waves the stars were bathed
or extinguished in the evening, to be rekindled in the morning
on the opposite side.</p>

<p>By saying that the Bear alone does not bathe in the waters
of Ocean<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>the poet plainly shows that Ursa Minor, and the other circumpolar
constellations, were unknown in his time.</p>

<p>If the knowledge of these constellations was from the
beginning so useful and so necessary to navigation, the constellation
nearest to the pole could not, at first, have served
as a guide to any but a people essentially maritime. And here
we find the Ph&oelig;nicians, or Tyrians, in the foremost rank.</p>

<p>After reminding us that Ursa Major was also called Helice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
or "the spiral," as in the famous passage in the "Argonauta"

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and Ursa Minor, Cynosura,&mdash;that is, the dog's tail,&mdash;Manilius,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
a Latin poet, who wrote at the beginning of the Christian era,
goes on to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At one of the extremities of the world's axis are two
constellations, well known to the hapless mariner: they are
his guides when the bait of gain impels him across the
ocean. Helice is the larger, and describes the larger circle:
it is recognised by its seven stars, which rival one another in
splendour; and by this it is that the Greeks steer their barks.
The smaller, Cynosura, describes a lesser circle: it is inferior
both in size and lustre; but, according to the witness of the
Tyrians, is of greater importance. For the Ph&oelig;nicians no
safer guide exists when they seek to approach a coast invisible
from the high seas."</p>

<p>The testimony of Manilius is confirmed by that of Aratus
and Strabo. The pseudo-Eratosthenes, in his book on the
constellations, refers to Ursa Minor under the name of Φοινίκη,
the "Ph&oelig;nician." It appears, then, to be established that
the Ph&oelig;nicians were the first to group a constellation of the
same general outline as Helice, the Little Bear, or Ursa Minor.
But that, as we have already explained, the two constellations
do not lie in the same direction, every one may see:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Nec paribus positæ sunt frontibus; utraque caudam</div>
  <div class="i0">Vergit in alterius rostrum, sequiturque sequentem."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">Not in the same direction do they face:</div>
  <div class="i2">The one its tail towards the other's snout</div>
  <div class="i2">Turns, and they thus, pursuing, each pursue.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Certain it is that the Ph&oelig;nicians, as experienced seamen,
would guide their course by the constellation lying nearest
to the pole. But was this constellation the same which we
now-a-days call Ursa Minor? It is quite allowable for us to
put such a question, because everybody knows that, owing to
the movement of the terrestrial axis around the poles of the
ecliptic, the axis of the world (the terrestrial axis prolonged)
is displaced to an extent which becomes perfectly appreciable
at the end of a certain time.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> We may calculate, therefore,
that the pole, now situated, as we have already said, near the
star Polaris (α in Ursa Minor), was formerly at some distance
from it. So, at the epoch of the greatest prosperity of the
Ph&oelig;nician people, or about three thousand years ago, the
north pole would nearly correspond with a star in Draco,
now 24&deg; 52' distant.</p>

<p>[This constellation is shown in <a href="#Page_9">fig. 2</a>, between Ursa Major
and Ursa Minor; the α in Draco is a star surrounded by a
circle, like the Polar Star, α in Ursa Minor.]</p>


<p class="p1a">That the constellation of Draco was well known to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ancients, we may gather from a passage in the "Phenomena"
of Aratus, a work partly translated by Cicero:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Dragon, like the sinuous course of a river, uncoils his
long scaly body, and surrounds with undulating folds the two
constellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor."</p>

<p>Bringing together these different facts for the sake of comparison,
we arrive at the conclusion that the Polar Star, by
whose scintillating light the early mariners steered their tiny
keels, was not the Polaris of to-day&mdash;α in Ursa Minor&mdash;but
α in the constellation of the Dragon.</p>


<p class="p1a">The Arabs, those navigators of the Waterless Sea (as they
poetically designate the desert of Sahara), have bestowed particular
appellations on several stars; but they guide themselves
rather by their radiance than by their position. Thus, such
stars as α Draco, α Cepheus, α Cygnus, which have occupied,
and, in the course of centuries, will again occupy the place of
Polaris, have received no special denomination; while the stars
of Ursa Major, α and β (occupying the posterior angles of the
chariot), are called Dubke and Merak;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, which
follow in due succession&mdash;Phegæa, or Phad, Megrez, Alioth,
Mizar, and Ackaïr, or Benetnasch. Certain stars in the same
constellation, which are barely visible, have also received distinctive
names: such is Alcor, a star between the fifth and
sixth magnitude, in the tail of Ursa Major, between Mizar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and Benetnasch. This star, it is true, had a special use: it
served the Arabs as the test of a good eyesight.</p>

<p>A further proof that the Arabs founded their stellar nomenclature
almost exclusively upon the lustre and colour of the
stars, is obvious in the names which they gave to the stars
forming the constellation of Orion. (See Fig. 2.) Thus, α
and β, two stars of the first magnitude, occupying the right or
eastern shoulder, and the left or western foot of the giant-hunter,
are called respectively, Betelguese and Rigel; the
star γ, named Bellatrix, in the left shoulder, is of the second
magnitude, like the stars δ, ε, ζ, which represent Orion's Belt,
and bear the names of "the Three Kings" and "St James's
Staff." Now the star η marking the right knee or inferior
eastern angle of the brilliant trapezium, is only of the third
magnitude; therefore, it has received no special designation.</p>

<p>The colour by which some stars are distinguished could not
have failed to be remarked by those observers who first began
to enumerate, or take census of, the celestial bodies. Thus
Sirius, the most refulgent of the stars of heaven, situated in
Canis Major, is of a bluish-white, like Rigel; and Arcturus,
situated on the prolongation of the tail of Ursa Major, is
reddish-yellow, like Betelguese.</p>

<p>Sirius, or the Dog-star, rose heliacally at the hottest time of
the year, and hence the Greeks were accustomed to ascribe
all the diseases of the season to its influence. It was&mdash;</p>

<p>To sum up: the figurative grouping of the stars, the variety
of their luminous magnificence, their position towards Polaris,
the determination of that position by the longitudinal circles
passing through the axis of the world, and twisted perpendicularly
to this axis by the circles parallel to the Equator,&mdash;such
is the aggregate of the elements which must, at
a very early period, have presided over the enumeration
of those sparkling points, each of which is the centre of a
system.</p>


<p class="p1a">Finally, are there any stars which the eye cannot perceive?
Such a question would never have been propounded to the
ancients. And why? Because no reasoning would have
drawn from them an admission that it was possible by artificial
means to enlarge the range of our eyesight. They would have
deemed it madness to pretend to improve and develope what
is not of human creation; the visual apparatus, as it is bestowed
on us by nature, they supposed to be the most perfect
instrument which man could imagine. And, in truth, nothing
could fairly be objected to this way of looking at things.</p>


<p class="p1a">The 48 constellations (21 northern, 12 zodiacal, and 15
austral) indicated by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ptolem&oelig;us'">Ptolemæus</ins>, contain a total of 1026 stars,
whose relative positions had been determined by Hipparchus.
To undertake an enumeration of the stars, and to transmit the
result to posterity, appeared to Pliny an audacity before which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
even a god would have recoiled (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hipparchus&mdash;ausus, rem etiam
Deo improbam, annumerare posteris stellas</i>).<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Yet numerous doubts had already risen in the mind of
Hipparchus as to the accuracy of the number recognised. In
the first place, the ancients undoubtedly knew, as we do, that
the visual faculty is not the same in all individuals; that there
are some who, in the same celestial space, see more stars than
others. Many persons can discern up to stars of the seventh
magnitude, while with others the sight fails far within that
limit. The ancients must also have known, as we do, that,
for the enumeration to be complete, the sky must be observed
from all the points of the terrestrial surface on which man is
planted. Even in our own days the catalogues of the southern
heavens are far from being perfect. Finally, more than two
thousand years before the time of Galileo, Democritus had
already enunciated the opinion that the Milky Way was a mass
of innumerable stars. All these signs should have been
accepted as warnings against premature affirmations.</p>


<p class="p1a">The invention of telescopes suddenly enlarged the question,
and it became necessary to establish a line of demarcation
between the number of stars visible to the naked eye and the
number visible through the agency of the telescope. Argelander,
the author of the "Uranometria," has found that the
stars visible to the naked eye, over the entire surface of the
heavens, range from 5000 to 5800. Otto Struve, employing
Herschel's method of computation, has estimated at upwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of twenty millions (20,374,034) the number of stars visible
with the Herschel 20-feet telescope.</p>

<p>But, in presence of all the nebulæ resolvable into stellar
masses, and before the development of the artificial range of
our sight,&mdash;in presence, finally, of that hopeless perspective
which the more we discover the more we perceive how
much there remains to discover,&mdash;are we not forcibly carried
back to our point of departure?</p>

</div>

<p>Ought not the imagination which, at the first glance, led us
to believe the number of stars to be infinite,&mdash;ought it not to
draw us nearer to the truth?</p>

<p>How should the imagination reveal to us, without difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
what the intellect, assisted by the senses, can only discover
after ages of assiduous exertion?</p>

<p>These questions, it seems to us, are worthy of our studious
consideration.</p>

<span class="hidden">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> winter of 1867-68 will count among the
severest recorded in meteorological annals.
As early as the winter solstice the cold began
to make itself felt. In a few days the centigrade thermometer
sank to 12&deg; below zero, through the influence
of a very keen north-east wind. At Paris, where, on an
average, the winter temperature is two degrees higher
than in the surrounding country, the Seine was completely
frozen for upwards of a fortnight. To meet
with a similar phenomenon we must go back as far as
1788. In January 1830, when, on the 17th, the temperature
sank down to 17&deg;.3, the Seine was also frozen,
but the ice speedily melted. The extreme cold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
1788 coincides, like that of 1830, with the appearance of two
comets. In bringing together these and other similar facts,
some writers are induced to believe themselves authorised in
establishing theories which attribute a certain frigorific influence
to the comets. But no such coincidence existed in the
winter of 1867-68, nor in any other years signalised by the
occurrence of excessive frost.</p>


<p class="p1a">What are we to think of the supposed influence of the moon
upon the weather?</p>

<p>This question, so constantly revived, is here not out of
place. The exceptionally prolonged cold, during which the
thermometer remained for three weeks below zero, the barometer
oscillating between 76&deg; and 76&deg;·5, commenced on the 22d
of December, three days before the new moon; now, it is on
Christmas-day, at 48 min. past 11 p.m., that the moon is found
in conjunction,&mdash;that is to say, has become completely invisible
to us by passing between the earth and the sun. And the
thaw, which terminated this period of frost, commenced on
the 12th of the following January, just three days after the full
moon; the exact moment of its opposition, when the moon
reflected upon us the whole hemisphere of its borrowed lustre,
took place on the 9th, at 2 min. past 11 in the evening. It is
then in the neighbourhood of the syzygies (conjunction and
opposition) of the moon that we must place the commencement
and termination of the cold period to which we have
been alluding.</p>

<p>We should not have thought of recalling these coincidences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
if it had not occurred to us that some meteorologists, in accordance
with the popular belief, have attributed to the
syzygies a marked influence on the changes of the weather.
Toaldo has deduced from half-a-century's observations, taken
at Padua, this general fact, that the maximum of influence
manifests itself at the syzygies, and somewhat more at the new
than at the full moon; that the minimum coincides with the first
and second quarter; that the action of the perigee (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">minima</i>
distance of the moon from the earth) is equal to that of the
full moon; and that the action of the apogee (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">maxima</i> distance
of the moon from the earth) is double that of the
quarters. Observe that the Italian meteorologist extended
this influence to three days before and three days after a
phase, for the moon's passage through the syzygies; while
he restricted it to a day before and a day after, for the quadratures.</p>

<p>The work which Toaldo did for the climate of Padua,
Pilgram had already executed for that of Vienna. But the
result at which he arrived, after five-and-twenty years of observation
(from 1763 to 1788), was the contrary to that of Toaldo:
namely, that the new moon is the least active of all the phases
in reference to changes of weather. What, then, are we to conclude?
That the problem is one of extreme difficulty, and that
there are probably several elements necessary to its solution,
which at present escape us. Then, too, we ought to have a clear
understanding of what is meant by "changes of weather;" we
must eliminate all vagueness from the word, and not allow it
to be governed by any preconceived theory.</p>

<p>The earth is covered with snow; it is enveloped, as the
poets say, in a shroud of white. But this phrase, poetical
as it may appear, is, in reality, inadmissible. A shroud is
used to wrap round a dead body, a corpse, whose elements,
since they are no longer maintained united by the undefinable
principle of life, go to form other compounds,&mdash;more
permanent and lasting,&mdash;which will mingle with the earth, the
water, and the air. But the earth which the snow covers preserves,
on the contrary, the germ of life in the seeds and roots
of plants; it rests itself, only for the purpose of communicating,
at the return of spring, a new impulse to the sap, whose circulation
sleeps during winter.</p>

<p>The moment is propitious for studying the snow: come,
then, let us examine it.</p>

<p>And, first, what is snow? Put a little into the hollow of
your hand, and see what transpires.</p>

<p>It melts, and leaves nothing but water as a residuum.</p>

<p>Snow, then, is frozen water,&mdash;water which existed in the
atmosphere in the state of vapour, and which, to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the language of physicists, has passed from the gaseous
state into the liquid, and thence into the solid. If you
doubt its identity with water, let a chemist analyse a portion
of it for you: he will tell you that it is composed,
like distilled water, of hydrogen and oxygen, in the proportion
of two parts of the former to one part of the latter.
The reader will, of course, understand that we abstract all
foreign substances which may accidentally have got mixed
up with it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="484" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;A Snowy Landscape.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was once a wide-spread opinion that snow is favourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to vegetation, on account of the salts which it contains.
Analysis, however, gave a negative result; it
demonstrated the absence of these salts. Recourse was
then had to another hypothesis: it was supposed that the
air contained in snow is richer in oxygen than the free air,
and that to the action of this gas must be attributed its
fertilising property. Another error! The truth really is,
that snow maintains the soil which it covers at a perceptibly
constant temperature, and that, when thawing, it mellows
it by its aqueous infiltrations; so that if, before a fall of
snow, the earth has experienced the action of a strong frost
capable of killing injurious insects, all the chances will be
in favour of a fertile year.</p>


<p class="p1a">Snow forms crystals. To observe them clearly, you must
examine the snow which falls in very cold and dry weather.
It then appears to be a dust composed of little thin plates.
Look at the small flake which has fallen on your coat-sleeve;
it is isolated; hasten to examine it before it melts,
or before other flakes become amalgamated with it. What a
graceful star! (Fig. 6, <i>a</i>). It is formed of six regular rays.
There are others which have only three, four, or five rays.
But on inspecting these more closely, you see that many
of these rays are broken or abortive, and that, when finally
analysed, each star possesses the same number of rays.</p>

<p>Why are there continually six rays? Why are there never
more nor fewer than this number? One might suspect in
nature a peculiar affection for the number <em>six</em>; as, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
example, in the cells of the bees and the wasps, which form
a regular hexagon (Fig. 6, <i>b</i>). Why, in the infinity of
polygons, has the instinct of these insects only chosen one
hexagon? What is the reason for this preference?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="500" height="190" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>If you interrogate geometry, it will reply to you that, of all
the polygons inscribed in a circle (Fig. 6, <i>c</i>), there is but one
whose sides are equal to the radius of that circle; and this
polygon is exactly that of the bee and wasp's cell. Here,
then, is a very singular coincidence. If you afterwards
examine very minutely the work of the bee, you will find in
each cell of the honeycomb a pyramidal base, composed of
three equal rhombs, whose angles solve a grand geometrical
problem, that of giving the maximum of space with the
minimum of matter. The papier-maché combs of the wasp
are formed of a single row of cells, each of which has a nearly
level bottom. This is all that is required; for these cells
are destined, not for the reception of honey, but only of the
larvæ, the offspring of their architects.</p>

<p>Do not think that you have but to pick up a thumbful of
snow to procure your crystals! These change their form very
quickly, and it is almost impossible to detect it in snow which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
has remained for any length of time upon the ground. The
great flakes which fall in relatively mild weather, when the
temperature borders upon freezing-point, are often nothing
better than masses of small amorphous atoms of ice; to get
at the crystals, you must remove the kind of icy varnish which
encases them.</p>


<p class="p1a">For the accurate observation of the crystallisation of water
which precipitates itself in the air, we have at our disposal a
means as simple as convenient&mdash;a pane of glass. All we have
to do is to arrange everything in such a manner that the congelation
shall be both slow and certain; on this condition
alone can we obtain well-defined crystals. A cold room is
best adapted for this kind of experimentation; and thus you
will frequently see deposited upon the window-glass, in an
uninhabited chamber, some exceedingly graceful designs, as
follow.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="450" height="262" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>These are asteriæ,&mdash;arborescent, and leaf-like
crystals,&mdash;imitating the beautiful foliage of ferns and mosses.
The severer the cold, the more regular, be it understood, is the
formation of these crystals.</p>

<p>Owing to its dazzling whiteness, snow is a great reflector of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
light, and singularly illuminates the darkness of the winter
nights. The long dreary nights of the polar world are lit up
by the glories of the magnetic auroras, joined to the radiancy of
the snow. This induces us to repeat a question which we have
often addressed to ourselves, namely,&mdash;under what aspect
must the very varied changes which the solar light experiences
on the surface of our planet be presented to the inhabitants
of Mars and Venus? A more attentive observation of the
ashen-gray light of the moon, which appears to be principally
produced by the reflection of the more or less luminous face
of the earth, may perhaps one day provide us with an answer
to our question.</p>

<p>Before quitting this subject, let us remember that both snow
and frost are of great utility to the husbandman. The latter,
by expanding the humidity with which the hard clods are
penetrated, crumbles them into powder, and renders stiff land
porous, friable, and mellow. It also clears the soil from the
plague of insect life, which, if it increased without so powerful
a check, would probably prove a terrible injury to the crops.
Moreover, it so hardens in winter the moist soft ground as to
permit of the necessary field operations being carried on.
Snow, as Dr Child remarks,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> is even more useful. It covers
up the tender plants with a thick mantle, which defends them
against the attacks of excessive cold. "God giveth snow like
wool," and for somewhat the same purposes as wool. The
mantle which so closely wraps about the gaunt limbs of the
winter-stricken earth neither allows the internal heat to escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
nor the external cold to enter in. It has been found that the
inner surface of the snow seldom falls much below 32&deg; F.,
although the temperature of the external air may be many
degrees under the freezing-point; and it is known that this
amount of cold can be endured by the crops without injury,
so long as their covering protects them from the raking influence
of the wind. In climates where the winter's cold
is longer and more intense than in England, the protective
influence of snow is much more plainly shown. Where it
lies long and deep, it opens out routes that were impracticable
in summer on account of their ruggedness, and prepares a
smooth path for the sledge, or for the "lumberer," over which
the largest trunks of the forest may be carried with ease to the
river or canal.</p>

<p>In the polar regions (we quote from Dr Child) snow
supplies the ever-ready material out of which the Esquimaux
construct their houses, and hardy explorers extemporise
the huts in which they find shelter when absent
from their ships on distant expeditions. Nor are the ships
themselves considered "snug winter quarters" until their
sides have been banked up in walls of snow, and the roof
raised over the deck has been thickly covered with it.
Snow huts are warmer than might have been expected. If
built upon ice over the sea, their temperature is sensibly
influenced by the heat of the unfrozen water below, which
is said seldom to fall much under 40&deg; F. in any part of
the ocean. Even where the external temperature has sunk
to 20&deg; or 30&deg; below zero, sufficient warmth is produced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a snow hut by the huddling together of three or four
persons within it. When Dr Elisha Kane, the American
explorer, passed a cold arctic winter's night in a hut
beyond Smith's Sound, the temperature produced by its
complement of lodgers, and two or three oil lamps, reached
90&deg; F.; so that he was compelled by the heat to follow the
example of the rest of the party, and partially to divest
himself of his clothing. Yet in lat. 79&deg; N., Dr Kane marked
a temperature of 75&deg; below zero in the month of February.
No fluid could resist it. Even chloric ether became solid,
and the air was pungent and acrid in respiration.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Red Snow.</span></p>

<p>As if it had been ordained that there should be nothing
absolute in nature, snow itself, the very type of whiteness,
sometimes exhibits the most curious colouring. Who, for
instance, has not heard tell of <em>red snow</em>? Its existence
was even known to Pliny, the great Roman naturalist, and
he attributed it to a dust with which the snow became
covered after it had lain several days on the ground.
"Snow itself," he says<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> "reddens with old age" (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ipsa nix
vetustate rubescit</i>).</p>

<p>Benedict de Saussure was the first who described red
snow like a naturalist.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He observed it on the occasion of
his ascent of Mont Breven, near Chamounix, in 1760; and
was greatly astonished at seeing the snow tinted in various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
places of an extremely vivid red. "In the middle of
each patch," he says, "was the greatest intensity of colour,
and the middle, moreover, was of a lower level than the
edges. On examining this red snow closely, I saw that its
colour depended upon a fine powder which mingled with
it, and which penetrated to a depth of two or three inches.
This powder could not have descended from the summit of
the mountain, since it was found in localities isolated and
even remote from the rocks; nor did it seem to have been
deposited by the winds, since it did not lie in drifts. One
would have said that it was a production of the snow
itself, a residuum of its thaw.... What at first suggested
this opinion was the fact that the colour, extremely weak
on the edges of each concave patch, gradually grew deeper
as it approached the bottom, where the trickling water had
carried down a greater quantity of residuum."</p>


<p class="p1a">The learned Swiss naturalist found this red snow on many
other mountains, and during a certain period of thaw, subjected
it to various experiments, which led him to the conclusion
that it was a vegetable matter, "a dust, or pollen, of
the stamens of plants." Slightly odorous, it exhaled, during
combustion, a scent not unlike that of sealing-wax.</p>

<p>Ramond met with red snow in the Pyrenees, at an elevation
of 7800 feet. He discovered in it, when burnt on incandescent
coals, the odour of opium or of chicory. He supposed
that the little deep red lamellæ which coloured the snow were
mica, and looked upon the mica as a product of the decomposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the rocks by the action of the sun and breezes of
spring. But this opinion was overthrown by Captain Ross,
who, in 1819, found red snow in Baffin's Bay (lat. 85&deg; 54' N.), to
a depth of thirteen feet, over a soil perfectly free from mica.
Other explorers affirm that in those regions they have never
met with the red snow more than three to four inches deep.
Captain Parry, in his Polar voyage, found this coloured snow
principally in the track of his sledges; and, agreeing with Sir
John Ross, he supposed it to derive its redness from the
presence of a kind of mushroom, of the genus <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Uredo</i>, to
which Bauer has given the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Uredo nivalis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> According
to experiments made by Bauer on specimens brought from
the Polar regions, these tiny mushrooms are, on the average,
a fiftieth of a millimètre in diameter; they develop themselves
like vegetables; the youngest are sometimes colourless; when
entirely freed from snow, they grow black under the influence
of an intense cold, without losing their germinative faculty,
and give birth, under the influence of a higher temperature,
to a green matter.</p>


<p class="p1a">Let us continue to examine the difference of opinion between
naturalists.</p>

<p>De Candolle declared the red snow of the polar regions to
be identical with that of the Alps, after having carefully compared
the two. But he saw in it a genus of cryptogams,
differing from the genus <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Uredo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Robert Brown asserted that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>it was a kind of alga, allied to the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tremella cruenta</i>. Azara
was of this same opinion, except that, instead of a tremella,
he recognised in it an alga of the genus <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Protococcus</i>, which he
called <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Protococcus kermesinus</i>, because its colour resembled that
of the kermes, or cochineal.</p>

<p>In the opinion of the observers whom we have cited, the colouring
corpuscles of the snow belong to the vegetable kingdom. This opinion
was supported by numerous adherents, and soon acquired so great an
authority, that, in an assembly of naturalists at Lausanne, De Candolle
overwhelmed with sarcasm a communication from Lamont, Prior of the
Hospice of St Bernard, on the "animality of red snow." And yet this
last hypothesis was not so rash as might have been supposed; for Dr
Scoresby, to whom we owe a profound study on the crystalline forms of
snow, had already attributed to an animal matter the colouring of the
snow and polar ice.</p>

<p>Now-a-days, however, it may be regarded as finally settled
that this phenomenon is due to the immense aggregation of
minute plants belonging to the species called <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Protococcus
nivalis</i>;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> so called in allusion to the extreme simplicity of
its organisation, and the peculiar nature of its habitat. If we
place a portion of the snow coloured with this plant upon a
piece of white paper, says Mr Macmillan,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and allow it to melt
and evaporate, we find a residuum of granules just sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to give a faint crimson tinge to the paper. Placed under the
microscope, these granules resolve themselves into spherical
purple cells, from the 1/1000th to the 1/3000th part of an inch in
diameter. Each of these cells has an opening, surrounded by
serrated or indented lines, whose smallest diameter does not
exceed the 1/5000th part of an inch! When perfect, the plant is
not unlike a red-currant berry; as it decays, the red colouring
matter fades into a deep orange, and the deep orange changes
into a dull brown. The thickness of the wall of the cell does
not exceed the 1/20000th part of an inch! Each cell may be
considered a distinct individual plant, since it is perfectly
independent of others with which it may be aggregated, and
performs for and by itself all the functions of growth and
reproduction, having a containing membrane which absorbs
liquids and gases from the surrounding matrix or elements,
a contained fluid of peculiar character, formed out of these
materials, and a number of excessively minute granules,
equivalent to spores, or, as some would say, to cellular buds,
which are to become the genus of new plants. There is
something, adds Mr Macmillan, extremely mysterious in the
performance of these widely different functions, by an organism
which appears so excessively simple. That one and the same primitive
cell should thus minister equally to absorption, nutrition, and
reproduction, is an extraordinary illustration of the fact, that the
smallest and simplest organised object is, in itself, and for the part
it was created to perform in the operations of nature, as admirably
adapted as the largest and most complicated.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Eternal Snows.</span></p>

<p>The epithet "eternal" or "perpetual," applied to snow,
would appear to savour of the ambitious, if not of the profane.
Can we say of anything which belongs to earth that it is
"eternal?" Assuredly not. The earth has not always worn
the aspect which it now wears, and, at a period not far distant
from its origin, could not in any region have been covered
with snow. Now, whatever has had a beginning cannot be
eternal. Many authors have, for this reason, substituted for
the word <em>eternal</em> the word <em>perpetual</em>. But the latter is equally
inapplicable. Who will venture to affirm that our globe or its
system will endure <em>perpetually</em>?</p>

<p>This difficulty, however, is one which need not particularly
embarrass us. We have been long accustomed to
look upon language as a simple mask, or, at least, as a
very dubious interpreter of thought. And we shall, therefore,
continue to use indifferently the words "eternal" and
"perpetual."</p>


<p class="p1a">Let us suppose that two travellers set out from the equator,
that plane of separation between the northern and the southern
hemispheres. Let us also suppose that each proceeds in a
diametrically opposite direction to the other, pursuing his route
along one of those meridian lines which divide the earth into
longitudinal portions, like the slices of a melon (to compare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
great things with small). The following will be their climatic
stages:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At first the two travellers will each traverse a moiety of the
<em>torrid zone</em>, limited below and above the Equator by two parallel
circles,&mdash;in the northern hemisphere by the Tropic of Cancer,
and in the southern by the Tropic of Capricorn. Do not let
these appellations alarm you: they show, once more, the
narrow connexity of the heaven with the earth; <em>tropic</em>, coming
from the Greek &#964;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#8053; signifies a return&mdash;the sun returns from
his apparent excursions, after having passed from the tropics to
the zenith. For these circles form the extreme limits of the sun's
march towards the north and towards the south: they are the
two solstices&mdash;the summer solstice, when the sun enters the
zodiacal sign of Cancer, and the winter solstice, when it enters
the sign of Capricorn. The torrid zone is the only one which
is thus divided into two portions by the Equinoctial, and which
the sun passes twice a year to the zenith, that is, to the point
directly above the heads of the inhabitants.</p></blockquote>

<p>After having crossed the tropics, one of our two travellers
will enter the <em>North Temperate Zone</em>, bounded by the Arctic
Polar Circle&mdash;the other, the <em>South Temperate Zone</em>, bounded
by the Antarctic Polar Circle. Having passed the polar
circles, they will find themselves speedily arrested by ice and
snow which never melt&mdash;by eternal ice and snow. These inhospitable
regions compose the two <em>frigid zones</em>, which cover,
like two immense hoods (forming the 0·82 parts of the terrestrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
surface), the one, the northern hemisphere, the other, the
southern.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In their progress through these various climates, our two travellers
will arrive at a very curious comparative result,&mdash;that the
southern hemisphere is colder than the northern. This difference
becomes especially recognisable below the 50th degree of south
latitude; so that, after passing the Antarctic Circle, the ice opposes
the voyager's course with nearly insurmountable obstacles; while,
in the northern hemisphere, the whaler frequently penetrates to
Spitzbergen, situated much nearer to the Pole than to the Polar Circle.
This is a general fact; we confine ourselves to putting it forward.</p>


<p class="p1a">Let us now suppose that our two travellers, always ready to
compare the results of their inquiries, accomplish the ascent
of a very lofty mountain situated under the Equator, such as
Chimborazo. In the course of their ascent, they will traverse
the same climates and the same zones which had marked the
stages of their journey from the Equator to the Poles: at their
starting-point they will find themselves in the Torrid zone, then
will come the Temperate and the Frigid zones, the latter
rendered inaccessible by glaciers and eternal snows. These
vertical zones of the mountain are characterised by vegetables
and animals whose types are found in the corresponding
horizontal zones of the terrestrial surface. But what is most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
remarkable is, that there exists between the northern and the
southern slopes of the mountain the same difference as between
the southern and northern hemispheres: the line of the eternal
snows descends much lower on the northern than on the
southern slope, in the same manner as, in the southern hemisphere,
the polar ice advances much nearer the Equator than in
the northern.</p>

<p>Such is the general view-point which we must adopt for the
clearer comprehension of the details of observation. Of course,
when speaking of the limit of the eternal snows, we refer only
to the <em>lower</em> limit, that is to say, to the greatest elevation
attained by the snow-line in the course of a single year. As
for the <em>upper</em> limit, it entirely escapes us; for the summits of
the loftiest mountains do not reach the atmospheric strata
which, by virtue of their refraction, cannot contain any
vesicular, aqueous, or condensable vapour.</p>

<p>The line of eternal snow which, <em>at the poles</em>, is found on the
level of the ground, gradually rises as we approach the torrid
zone, where it attains its maximum of elevation, from 13,000
to 17,000 feet. This phenomenon does not exclusively depend
upon the geographical latitude, nor on the mean annual
temperature of the locality: it is the result of an aggregate of
diverse circumstances which we have not the space here to
enumerate and discuss. We shall content ourselves with
placing before the reader a table which will show the remarkable
differences existing in the height of the perpetual snow-line
in various places.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Inhabitants of the Eternal Snows.</span></p>

<p>If men have the faculty of living under all climates, they
make use of that faculty, as we know, with extreme reserve.
They have never permanently inhabited the polar regions and
the perpetually snowy summits of the mountains: it is only
at intervals that a few pioneers have temporarily ventured
thither. Starting from this fact, it was long believed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
zone of eternal snows was not inhabited by any living being.
Even men of science admitted, as an article of faith, that
where man could not fix his residence no animal could live.
They made, however, a concession with respect to vegetables,
and particularly as regarded the lichens and the mosses.</p>

<p>Well, observation and research conjointly, have erased this
article of faith from the scientific code. It has been demonstrated
that the icy regions, which man visits only at rare
intervals, and where he sojourns but for a time, are the home
of a certain number of animal species, more or less allied to
the human species. The scientific exploration of these regions
dates only from our own time. Spitzbergen, and the
summit of the Alps,&mdash;such are our points of comparison.</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive of anything more interesting than
the historical exposition of the limited <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Fauna glacialis</i>. First,
let us take the discovery, comparatively recent, of a small
rodent of the mouse order.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Arvicola Leucurus, or Arctic Vole.</span></p>

<p>On the 8th of January 1832, a Swiss naturalist, M. Hugi,
started from Soleure to study the winter condition of the
classic glacier of Grindelwald. The undertaking was in many
respects a difficult one; the sides of the Mettenberg, bordering
on this glacier, were covered with an uniform stratum of
hardened snow; a pathway had to be cut out with the pickaxe.
M. Hugi and his companions did not arrive at the
Stierreg until towards evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="339" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>&mdash;Among the Alps.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A goatherd lives there during the summer. They sought
around and about for his little cabin, but, on the uniform white
carpet of snow which covered everything, no sign of it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
be detected. At length they came upon a little mound, which
they immediately proceeded to excavate; and late in the
night they discovered the roof of the hut. They then redoubled
their efforts to sweep away the snow obstructing the
door. On opening it a score of mice emerged from the cabin,
some of which they killed.</p>

<p>For a picture of the poor victims we are indebted to M.
Hugi. "These little rodents are of a yellowish gray, and very
slender; from the head to the tip of the tail they measure
about nine inches. The hind paws are of a length wholly
disproportionate to the fore paws. The tail and ears are
naked; their transparency is remarkable.... This animal,"
adds M. Hugi, "appeared to me completely unknown, and I
do not remember to have seen it in any zoological collection."</p>

<p>After determining its genus and species, the intrepid explorer
of the Alps was entitled to have given it a name; but this
honour escaped him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="400" height="214" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;The Arctic Vole.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The same little rodent has since been found in many other parts of
the Alps; notably among the rocks of the Grands-Mulets, some 12,500
feet above the sea-level.</p>

<p>Desirous of comparing the climate of Spitzbergen with that
of the summit of the Alps, M. Martins established himself, in
1841, with his friend, A. Bravais, on the Faulhorn. "While,"
he says, "we were engaged in our experiments, we often perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a little animal passing swiftly by us, and stealthily gliding
into its burrow. We remarked that it was also found in
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">auberge</i>, or inn, and that it fed upon Alpine plants. At
the first glance, its resemblance to the common mouse led
us to think that this inconvenient guest had followed man
into his abode on the Faulhorn, as it had formerly crossed the
seas on board ship. But a more attentive examination showed
me that, far from being a mouse, it was a species of vole,
which had hitherto escaped the researches of naturalists. I
designated it by the name of the snow-vole, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arvicola nivalis</i>."</p>

<p>It was the same animal which M. Hugi had discovered
nine years before. The ice was broken, and names, both
generic and specific, afterwards fell like hail on the body of
our poor little rodent. Some would have had it called&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hypudæus alpinus.<br />
Hypudæus petrophilus.<br />
Hypudæus nivicola.<br />
Hypudæus Hugei.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others, and fewer in number, preferred the designation of
"White-tailed Vole,"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Arvicola leucurus.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others again, "the Lebrun vole,"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Arvicola Lebrunii.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which of all these names shall prevail? We cannot say,
and it matters very little to us. Perhaps the nomenclators
may in time agree among themselves upon the appellation of
the genus. However this may be, we know&mdash;and it is an important
fact&mdash;that a mammal exists at altitudes where men
could not live, and that he is found in the Alps, above even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the lower limit of the perpetual snows. Is it the only mammal
which can live at such a height?</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Marmot.</span></p>

<p>Who, in the wide world of London, where so many waifs
and strays are drifting with the great current of human life,
has not observed the Savoyard wanderer with his dancing
marmot? If the man did not attract our notice, his curious
companion would. In form he belongs partly to the bear,
and partly to the rat. Naturalists have, therefore, expressly
created for him the genus <cite>Arctomys</cite>,&mdash;a Latinised Greek name,
signifying "The Bear-Rat."</p>

<p>In fact, the marmot resembles Harlequin's cloak, or rather,
if it be permissible to compare little things with great, the
Austrian Empire,&mdash;a composite of territories and races; and
Buffon has described him very aptly. He has, he says,
the nose, the lips, and the shape of the head of the hare;
the hair and nails of the badger; the teeth of the beaver; the
cat's whiskers; the eyes of the dormouse; the feet of the bear,
with a short tail and truncated ears.</p>

<p>Add to this that the marmot&mdash;he is a little larger than a
rabbit&mdash;is omnivorous like man and the bear, with whom he
shares his aptitude for dance and sport. While he eats any
and everything, he nevertheless prefers vegetable food to all
other kinds; and with his orange-coloured incisors gnaws the
bark of shrubs. He rarely drinks, but when he does drink
takes a hearty draught; is particularly fond of milk; drinks it
by raising his head at each mouthful, like a hen, and giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
utterance to an audible murmur of contentment, just as if he
were reciting his <cite>Benedicite</cite>. Will it be in allusion to this
characteristic that the common French phrase has originated,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Marmotter des prières</i>?<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>During the summer the marmots inhabit the snowy summits
of the Alps. At the beginning of autumn they descend
to a lower level, for the purpose of excavating the burrows in
which they pass the winter, completely benumbed by the
frost. This is the time when the hunters easily capture them;
they have nothing to do but to dig (<em>creuser</em> is the technical
word); and frequently they are found as many as ten or
twelve in the same burrow, rolled up like balls, and buried in a
litter of hay. Their sleep, says De Saussure, is so profound,
that the hunter deposits them in his sack and carries them away
without awakening them. The Chamounix hunters, he adds,
have already entirely expelled or destroyed the goats formerly
so abundant on their mountains; and it is probable that, in
less than a century, we shall see neither chamois nor marmots.</p>

<p>This prophecy of De Saussure's is on the point of being
realised. Still, even at the present day, marmots are not very
rare in the Valais and the canton of Ticino (du Tissin), where
they are called <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mure montane</i> (mountain rats); a phrase from
which is derived, without doubt, the appellation <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">marmot</i>.
They prefer as their abode the stony islets which rise here
and there in the midst of the rocks. The ears of travellers
who venture into the barrenest recesses of the Alps of the
Bernese Oberland are sometimes struck by a very sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
whistling, for which, at first, they find it difficult to account.
It is the young marmot's cry of alarm; for the old appear to
be deprived of this strident faculty.</p>

<p>For a considerable period only a single species was known&mdash;the
marmot properly so called (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arctomys marmotta</i>, Gmelin);
but four others must now be added:&mdash;1st, The marmot of the
Caucasus (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arctomys musicus</i>), still imperfectly known; 2d, The
marmot of Canada (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arctomys empetra</i>), who clambers up the
trees like a cat, and is distributed throughout all North
America, particularly in Hudson's Bay, and Alaska, on the
north-west coast; 3d, The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arctomys monax</i>, who appears to be
peculiar to Maryland; 4th, The Russian marmot (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arctomys citillus</i>),
of the size of a field-mouse, and of a brown colour,
spotted with white; 5th, The marmot of Siberia (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arctomys
bobac</i>), smaller than the common species, of a yellow gray, and
building vast burrows shaped like a funnel.</p>

<p>Will the reader permit us an allusion, in passing, to a question
which we do not see discussed in books of natural
history? Formerly among the treasures of ancient druggists
figured a kind of panacea, called "Graetz's balls." What
were these "Graetz's balls," at one time esteemed as a universal
medicine, but no longer included in our pharmacopeia?</p>

<p>This was their origin:&mdash;The subterranean dwellings which
certain species of marmots construct with so much skill, are
each composed of two galleries, which unite together like the
arms of a Y, and terminate in a <em>cul-de-sac</em>. There are found
the globules of clay known as "Graetz's balls." They are
an industrial product of our rodents, as M. Oscar Schmidt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
established in 1866, by close observation of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arctomys
bobac</i> of the Zoological Garden of Vienna. The marmot
creates these balls by scratching up the earth, and appears
to amuse himself&mdash;a child's amusement!&mdash;by rolling them to
and fro in his galleries.</p>

<p>Must we omit this graceful ruminant from the number of
mammals inhabiting the eternal snows? No; for it is not of
his own will that the chamois has taken refuge upon the snowy
peaks of the Alps. If we meet with him there, it is because he
seeks to shelter himself from the destructive instincts of man.</p>

<p>The chamois is one of those animal species which, before
a century, perhaps, will have disappeared; his bones will then
figure in the palæontological museums by the side of the
skeletons of extinct species. There, too, will be displayed
the famous <em>chamois balls</em>, each of the size of a nut, covered
with a shining substance resembling leather, of an agreeable
odour, and seeming to be a morbid dejection, composed of
roots and other undigested matter. These balls, the <em>bezoars</em>
of the old physicians, were regarded as a remedy against every
ill the human flesh is heir to; it was even professed that they
rendered soldiers invulnerable, and were a better defence
against bullets than the finest armour ever wrought by the
smiths of Milan. How precious a remedy for this epoch of
civilisation, when man&mdash;is he much wiser than his supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
progenitor, the ape?&mdash;seeks to replace the cholera and the
pestilence by the most terrific engines of destruction!</p>


<p class="p1a">The birds inhabiting the inhospitable region of the snows
are more numerous than the mammals. Let us briefly refer
to a few of the more important.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Eagle and the Wren.</span></p>

<p>In speaking of the eagle, Tennyson's noble lines to that
"imperial bird" will occur to every reader, from the force and
clearness of the picture which they present:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"He clasps the crag with hookèd hands;</div>
  <div class="i0">Close to the sun in lonely lands,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ringed with the azure world, he stands.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;</div>
  <div class="i0">He watches from his mountain walls,</div>
  <div class="i0">And like a thunderbolt he falls."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The affection of the eagle for his "mountain walls" may
be easily understood. This giant bird, with his carnivorous
instincts, is endowed with a remarkable tenacity of life,
and can exist in habitats wholly inaccessible to man. But
it is strange that a bird, which is as common a type of
humility as the eagle is of ambition, and which we almost
always cite as a contrast to the eagle&mdash;we mean, the delicate
little wren&mdash;should also be found among the snow and ice,
the silence and solitude, of the loftiest mountain regions.</p>

<p>To study the flight of the eagle, we should repair to
Alpine highlands. When he has reached a certain altitude
of the atmosphere, the royal bird descends obliquely, as
upon an inclined plane, with a rush and a din of wings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and at a speed of upwards of thirty-six yards per second.
We assured ourselves of the accuracy of this fact during
an ascent of Mount Hochk&oelig;rpf, in the canton of Glaris.
The bird traversed in six minutes a space of 40,000 Swiss
feet, which is equal to about forty yards per second. This
result agrees, on the whole, with the observations of a
traveller, who wrote in the <cite>Nouvelle Gazette de Zurich</cite>, on
the 26th of August 1863:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A society of tourists set out from Corri to climb the
Stützerhorn, which is 8400 feet in height. From the summit
they perceived an enormous eagle, which, having taken
his flight from Calanda, beyond the Rhine, directed his
course towards the Stützerhorn, for the purpose of halting,
after a certain inflection, on the side of the Rothhorn."</p>

<p>The duration of the flight was five minutes; the interval
between the starting-point and the point of arrival, two
French leagues and a half. In three hundred seconds,
therefore, the eagle must have traversed a space of 3000
Swiss feet, which is equal to a speed of forty-five yards
per second. Hence, the swiftness of the eagle's flight is
nearly equal to the velocity of sound.</p>

<p>One of the most admirable descriptions of the habits of
this bird with which we are acquainted, is furnished by the
well-known naturalist Macgillivray:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There he stands"&mdash;on his lonely crag&mdash;"nearly erect,
with his tail depressed, his large wings half raised by his
side, his neck stretched out, and his eye glistening as he
glances around. Like other robbers of the desert, he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
a noble aspect, an imperative mien, a look of proud defiance;
but his nobility has a cast of clownishness, and his falconship
a vulturine tinge. Still he is a noble bird, powerful, independent,
proud, and ferocious, regardless of the weal or woe
of others, and intent only on the gratification of his own
appetite; without generosity, without honour; bold against
the defenceless, but ever ready to sneak from danger. Such
is his nobility, about which men have so raved.</p>

<p>"Suddenly he raises his wings, for he has heard the whistle
of the shepherd on the crag, and bounding forward, he springs
into the air. Hardly do those vigorous flaps serve at first to
prevent his descent, but now curving upwards, he glides majestically
along. As he passes the corner of that buttressed
and battlemented crag, forth rush two ravens from their nest,
croaking fiercely. While one flies above him, the other steals
beneath, and they essay to strike him, but dare not, for they
have an instinctive knowledge of the power of his grasp; and,
after following him a little way, they return to their home,
vainly exulting in the thought of having driven him from their
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"But on a far journey, he advances in a direct line, flapping
his great wings at regular intervals, then shooting along without
seeming to move them. In ten minutes he has progressed three
miles, although he is in no haste, and now disappears behind
the shoulder of the hill. But we may follow him in imagination,
for his habits being well known to us, we may be allowed
the ornithological license of tracing them in continuance."</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;The Eagle's Habitat.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Homeward bound,&mdash;Mr Macgillivray continues,&mdash;after having
supplied his own wants, he knows that his young must be
provided with food. Therefore he sweeps across the moor, at
a height of two or three hundred feet, bending his course to
either side, his wings wide-spread, his neck and feet retracted,
now beating the air, and again sailing smoothly along. Suddenly
he halts, poises himself for a moment, stoops, but recovers
himself without touching the ground. The object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
his regards, a golden plover, which he spied on her nest, has
contrived to elude him, and he does not care to pursue her.
Now, then, he ascends a little, wheels in short abrupt curves,
presently rushes down headlong, assumes the horizontal position
when close to the ground, prevents himself from being
dashed against it by expanding his wings and tail, thrusts forth
his talons, and grasping a poor, terrified ptarmigan that sat
cowering among the gray lichens, squeezes it to death, raises
his head exultingly, utters a clear, shrill cry, and, rising from
the ground, pursues his journey.</p>

<p>As he passes a tall cliff overhanging a silent lake, he is
attacked by a fierce peregrine falcon, which darts and plunges
at him, as if resolved to deprive him of his booty, or drive him
headlong to the ground. A more formidable foe is this than
the raven; and the eagle, with a scream and a yelp, throws
himself into postures of defence, until, at length, the hawk,
perceiving that the tyrant has no intention of plundering his
nest, leaves him to pursue his course without further molestation.
Over dense woods, and green fields, and scattered
hamlets, the eagle speeds; and now he enters the long river-valley,
near whose upper end, cradled in mist, rises the rock of
his eyrie. About a mile from it he meets his mate, who has
been abroad on a similar design, and is returning with a white
hare as her spoil. With loud strident cries they congratulate
each other, cries that alarm the drowsy shepherd on the green
strath below, who, remembering the lambs carried off in spring-time,
discharges at them a volley of maledictions.</p>

<p>Their nest is of considerable size, but rudely constructed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a pile of twigs and heather and dead sticks, somewhat hollow
in the middle, where lies a thin deposit of wool and feathers.
Here repose the eaglets, two in number, and clothed in soft
white down.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;The Lammergeier.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Independently of the species which, like the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pandion
haliætus</i>, and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aquila nævia</i>, inhabit the lower regions, the
eagles which visit the Alps are very remarkable. Thus, the
species of <em>Gypaëtos</em>, which the inhabitants designate under the
name of the <em>Lammergeier</em>, or "Lamb-slayer," is the European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
condor. The spread of his wings is about ten feet; he weighs
from eighteen to twenty-four pounds, and can easily carry off
in his talons kids, lambs, and even children.</p>

<p>The <em>Steinadler</em>, which, like the preceding, belongs to the
inaccessible mountains of the cantons of Glaris, Schwyz, the
Grisons, Appenzell, and Berne, would seem to be a variety
or sub-species of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aquila imperialis</i>. The inhabitants of
Eblingen, a village on the borders of the Lake of Brienz,
hunt him vigorously. Finally, some eagles there are which
only sojourn in the Alps temporarily; they appear to be
astray; such are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The <em>Circæetus leucopsis</em>, which has a particular affection for
serpent-haunted districts;</p>

<p>The <em>Haliætus leucocephala</em>, with head and tail of a milky
white, belonging to the north of Europe and America; and</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Neophron percnopterus</i>, or Egyptian eagle, of carrion-like
odour, which is sometimes met with in the neighbourhood
of Geneva.</p></blockquote>

<p>The tawny-headed vulture (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vultur fulvus</i>), and the ashy
vulture (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vultur cinereus</i>), with gray-brown mouth, and a
brownish collar round his bare neck, are extremely rare in
Switzerland.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;The Wren.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The wren here referred to is a British species, the common
wren, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Troglodytes vulgaris</i>, one of the smallest of
our British songsters; a restless, lively bird, which twitters
about the hedgerows in summer, and about the garden and
shrubbery in winter, and chanting his mellow song even
under the gloomy sky of December. Allied to this familiar
bird is the Gold-crowned Knight,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sylvia regulus</i>, which is
found in the Alpine deserts at an elevation of 9000 to 10,000 feet.
Like our own Jenny Wren, he has a very fine, slender bill, which
denotes his insectivorous propensities. He is easily known by the
little crest of silky feathers which he wears on his head, like a
diadem, and also by his peculiar cry of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">souci-î-î-î</i>.</p>

<p>Our crowned knight is very partial to the society
of the tits, and, like them, he is easily caught with birdlime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
He is so fond of the company of other birds, that,
when he finds himself alone, he becomes disquieted; his
prolonged tiny chirp grows plaintive; and he flies to and
fro in quest of comrades. He may be regarded as a trustworthy
barometer, for, prior to rainy weather, his song is
very loud and incessant. Devoted to the pursuit of insects
or their larvæ, he seems to pay no attention to the passer-by;
he flutters vivaciously from branch to branch, and puts himself
in all imaginable positions, sometimes with his head
upwards, sometimes with his head downwards. We have
often watched, with extreme gratification, the acrobatic
tricks of our Lilliputian gymnast. Occasionally, before he
perches, you will see him, in a frenzy of indecision, rapidly
agitating his wings, and revolving them like a wheel. If
you look at him, while thus engaged, <em>against</em> the light, you
will think you see a tiny, ethereal, diaphanous spinning-top.
After "assisting" at such a spectacle, which the first wood
will furnish, you will not be indisposed to admit with us,
that the bird designated by the Greeks &#964;&#961;&#959;&#967;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#962;, or "little
wheel," and whose identity has so often been discussed,
was, in reality, our golden-crested knight. Moreover, he
is a true cosmopolite, in every acceptation of the word.
Not only does he never quit us, not only does he remain
faithful to us throughout the year, but we meet with him
over all Europe. He is also found in Asia, and even, it
is said, in America, from the West Indies to Canada. His
flight being very short, it is supposed that he passed from
one hemisphere to another by way of Behring's Strait. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is certain, at all events, that he discovered the New World
before Christopher Columbus.</p>

<p>During the severe cold of the winter of 1867-8, we saw our
knight&mdash;a very rare circumstance&mdash;haunt the vicinity of our
houses, though he prefers the green shade of the forests, and
especially of the forests of pine and fir. He who has seen
him pecking at the bark and leaves of these trees, while
the ground was covered with snow, and during a frost of
10&deg; below zero (C.), will feel no astonishment at meeting him
upon the snowy summits of the Alps.</p>

<p>Yet this pet bird of ours, this Lilliputian warbler, does not
weigh more, with all his feathers, than a quarter of an ounce,
or the two thousandth part of an eagle. Away with the hunter
who would attempt such tiny game! A bird so small that he
glides through the meshes of a net,&mdash;so delicate, that if you
would not irreparably injure your "specimen," you must shoot
him with a few grains of finest shot,&mdash;a bird of such frail
appearance, withstanding all climates, and distributed over
the entire surface of the globe,&mdash;here is a subject worthy
the meditation of man, who pretends to be the "lord of
creation!"</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Snow-Bunting</span>&mdash;(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Emberiza plectrophanes nivalis</i>).</p>

<p>This is the snow-lark-bunting of Macgillivray, and a species
of the genus <em>Plectrophanes</em>. In Scotland, he is frequently
called the Snow-flake, and, in other parts of Great Britain,
the Snow or Oat-fowl. His weight does not exceed an ounce
and a half. His bill and legs are black; his forehead and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
crown white, with an admixture of black on the hind part
of the head; black are the back and sides, but each wing
is marked by a broad belt of white; the quill feathers are
black, with white bases; the secondaries are white, with
black spots on the interior webs.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;The Crests of Inaccessible Rocks.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The snow-bunting's favourite localities, where he loves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
build his nest, are the crests of inaccessible rocks, surrounded
by vast fields of snow, in whose midst the sun and tempest
have created a few oases. The most he does is to approach
the hospices of Monts St Bernard and St Gothard, and construct
his nest under the eaves of their roofs. This nest, made
of long blades of grass, is lined internally with hair and the
feathers of poultry. At the beginning of May, the female
lays six eggs of a snowy whiteness, and the male assists in
hatching them, and bringing up the young. The bill of the
latter is, at first, of a bright yellow, which turns black, like
that of the parents, as they grow older.</p>

<p>The snow-bunting rarely descends into the wooded region.
Of a very sprightly disposition, he spends nearly all his life
in the midst of the snows and the ice. His song somewhat
resembles that of the finch, which he also resembles in size
and social instincts; for he may frequently be seen in numerous
bands hovering above the highest mountains.</p>

<p>The snow-bunting is also met with in the northern districts
of Asia and America.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Red-Billed Crow</span>&mdash;(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corvus pyrrhocorax</i>).</p>

<p>The familiar cry of this bird, who resembles the thrush,&mdash;the
<em>krapp-krapp</em> of the red-billed crow (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la corneille des nieges</i>),&mdash;agreeably
falls on the ear of the traveller, when wandering
through solitudes devoid of any other living being. By their
cries and their presence these birds animate the denuded
rocks which rise like promontories in seas of ice. They are
easily distinguished from other species by their coral-red bills;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
whence their name of <em>Pyrrhocorax</em>. They nest in troops in
the crevices of the most inaccessible rocks, and propagate
there from generation to generation. Their presence is indicated
by enormous heaps of ordure, veritable guano, which
might well be used for manure. Their abrupt ascents and
strident cries are signs of bad weather, which the mountaineer
knows how to profit by.</p>

<p>If caught when young, these birds are easily domesticated.
M. Tschudi, in his "Life among the Alps," relates the history
of one who had been tamed. He would himself go in quest
of the bread, cheese, and fruits which composed his repast;
then, holding in his claws the prize he had coveted, devour it
with avidity. What remained of his meal he carefully concealed
in paper, and would gallantly defend the hidden treasure
against whomsoever dared to approach it, against dogs
as well as man. Fire had a singular attraction for him; he
would extract from a lamp the burning wick, and swallow it
without sustaining any injury; he would swallow even the
<em>débris</em> of the charcoal as he fluttered about the chimney. He
showed an excessive joy at the sight of smoke, and loudly
clapped his wings. Whenever he caught sight of any burning
coal, he did not fail to pick up immediately all the paper, rags,
or twigs he could lay his claws on; these he would place
in the stove, and amuse himself by watching the smoke they
gave forth. If a stranger entered the room, he gave vent to
the most deafening cries, though he was exceedingly gentle
and familiar towards persons with whom he was acquainted.
His friends and favourites he distinguished in a peculiar manner;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
he ran in front of them, displayed his joy by expanding
his wings, and alternately perched himself on their hands, their
head, their shoulders, eyeing them all over, and bending his
head as if to kiss them. Every morning he entered his
master's bedroom, called him by his name, posted himself on
his pillow, and waited tranquilly until he awoke; then he expressed
his satisfaction by all kinds of gestures and noises.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Reptiles.</span></p>

<p>Close to the line of perpetual snow a black variety of vipers
has been met with; but none of the serpent race ever <em>cross</em>
that line.</p>

<p>The only reptile found within the boundaries of the snowy
region is a kind of lizard (<em>Zootoca pyrrhogastra</em>), the only one,
perhaps, of all the vertebrata which could live at an elevation
above the sea-level of more than 9500 feet, buried in the
snow for upwards of ten months.</p>

<p>During the few bright summer weeks, he feeds upon some
rare insects and spiders.</p>

<p>The frigid zone is so far the natural habitat of these lizards,
that they would rather die of hunger than live in the more
genial regions to which men have wished to transplant them.
In length they nearly equal our common lizards, but they are
not quite so big; their back is of a chesnut brown, marked
with black streaks and dots; the throat is bluish; the belly of
the male is of a greenish blue, spotted with black, while that of
the female is of so lively a red as to have suggested the name
of the species, <em>Pyrrhogastra</em>; just as the name of the genus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
is derived from the circumstance that the young are hatched
in the mother's belly, and are born alive like the young of a
mammal. This statement, too, holds good with respect to the
viper, which also endures the cold of elevated regions.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Inferior Animals.</span></p>

<p>Our information is still very incomplete so far as relates to
the molluscs, the arachnida, and the insects which inhabit the
frigid zone. The Alpine snail (<em>Helix Alpicola</em>), so remarkable
for its transparency, appears to be the sole mollusc which, in
certain localities, attains to an elevation of 7000 feet. It is,
however, surpassed by the earthworm, which is not only
distributed over the surface of every country, but ascends to
the snowy summits of the loftiest mountains. Few animals
have their geographical distribution so extended both horizontally
and vertically; and only some species of spiders and
millepeds keep company with the earthworm.</p>

<p>Among the other inhabitants of the snows have also been
observed a dozen species of butterflies,&mdash;nearly all diurnal,&mdash;for
the phalænæ (?), or nocturnal Lepidoptera, appear to be much
more sensible to the cold. M. Agassiz saw the "Little Vulcan"
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vanessa urticæ</i>) fluttering in the snowy desert which borders
on the glacier of Aar, as if it were completely in its element.
The wings of the majority of these butterflies are sombre-coloured;
their caterpillars live upon the auriculas, and seem
to accomplish their metamorphoses in regions uninhabitable
to us. The leaf-wasp (<em>Tenthredo spinacula</em>) appears to deposit
its larvæ, at a height of nearly 10,000 feet, in the galls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of the Alpine rose (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">rhododendron ferrugineum</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">rhododendron
hirsutum</i>.)</p>


<p class="p1a">The coleoptera have also numerous representatives in the
region of perpetual snows, with this difference&mdash;equally characteristic
of other animals&mdash;that, upon the southern declivity,
they ascend 1000 to 1500 feet higher than on the northern.
We may mention, as specially distributed in the topmost zone
of the Alpine world:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chrysomela salicina</i>, a pretty little beetle, sometimes
blue, sometimes deep green, and finely punctuated, which lives
almost exclusively upon a species of dwarf willow (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Salix
retusa</i>).</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nebria Escheri</i>, a black beetle, about two thirds
of an inch long, with feet and antennæ of a brownish
red; and</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nebria Chevrierii</i>, with rust-coloured feet and antennæ,
common in the sources of the Rhine.</p></blockquote>


<p class="p1a">Special mention must be made of the <em>Snow-Flea</em>. Do not
think we are referring to an insect of the same species as our
common fleas: the snow-flea approximates much more closely
to the lice family than to the fleas, though it hops like the
latter. The history of its discovery dates back as far as 1839.
At this epoch, M. Desor, a learned Swiss naturalist, had
undertaken some researches upon the glaciers. Accompanied
by some friends, he set out from the hospice of the Grimsel,
and arrived in the vicinity of the glacier of the Lower Aar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
He had commenced his observations, when suddenly he heard
Agassiz calling him, and shouting, "Come, come, make haste;
here are your Mont Rosa fleas." Desor ran to the spot, and
saw under a stone the little creatures whom Agassiz persisted
in taking to be veritable lice, pretending they had been
accidentally brought to these heights.</p>

<p>"I recognised with extreme joy," says M. Desor, "the little
creatures whose loss I had regretted a year before. They are
not pretty, but, on the contrary, very ugly. However, they
showed, in opposition to the opinion of Agassiz, that they really
inhabited the glacier, and were not merely chance visitors. We
found them by thousands under other stones. ... Our guide,
with whom the glaciers were old acquaintances, had never
seen them before, and the tiny creatures excited his astonishment.
What surprised us most was the rapidity with which
they penetrated into even the most compact ice, till they
resembled blood-corpuscles circulating in their vessels. This
fact shows that there exist, in the hardest and most transparent
ice, certain capillary fissures which escape an unskilled eye:
it also proves that the glaciers, on their surface, and down to
a certain depth, are by no means incompatible with the development
of organised beings."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The tiny insect in question was at first baptized by the
name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Desoria saltans</i> (order of the <em>Thysanouræ</em> of Latreille),
but has since received definitively the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Desoria glacialis</i>.
It belongs to the family of the <em>Poduræ</em>, singular creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
which, by virtue of their form, are a link between the earwigs
and the spiders.</p>

<p>These are its generic characters:&mdash;</p>

<p>The body elongated, cylindrical, garnished with long setiform hairs,
and composed of eight segments, six of which are perfectly distinct,
and two (the two latter) very short, and scarcely perceptible;
four-jointed antennæ, longer than the head; long, slender, cylindrical
feet; forked tail, silky, and transversely wrinkled; seven eyes,

</div>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Desoria glacialis</i>, a species at present unique, is of a
velvety black, and about one-sixth of an inch in length.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Podura plumbea</i> (or "Spring Tail"),
common enough in England, and found
under all kinds of stones, will give the
reader an idea of the flea of the glaciers.</p>

<p>On comparing these two species, we
remark, first, that the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Podura plumbea</i>
is somewhat longer and thicker in body
than the flea of the glaciers (see Fig.
16; <i>a</i>, natural size; <i>b</i>, enlarged); but it
is more particularly by the length of its antennæ that we
distinguish it. It owes its specific name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Plumbea</i> to
the livid blue or leaden colour of the scales which cover
its body. These scales resemble those of butterflies; only
they are much smaller, more finely situated, and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
variable in form and size (Fig. 17). In catching it great
care is required, for it is so easily crushed; it is, besides,
very soft to the touch, though, when examined
with a microscope, it is seen to bristle all
over with hairs, apparently very hard.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 205px;">

</div>

<p>Our <em>poduræ</em> have also the faculty of
leaping, and cling by thousands to humid
places, especially to mosses and the under-surface of
stones. The mechanism of their leap is explained by the
presence of a forked, flexible, and elastic appendage,
lodged in a kind of ventral groove beneath the last
segments; by projecting this rapidly behind, the whole
body of the animal is thrown forward. At the slightest contact
the insect folds up its caudal appendage under its belly,
and you would then suppose it did not possess one. This
circumstance explains why, in many books of natural history
of good repute, the <em>poduræ</em>, and especially so common a
species as the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Podura plumbea</i>, are represented without this
characteristic instrument.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Herbaceous Plants which best endure the cold
of Winter.</span></p>

<p>The "way to look at things," which is the true foundation
of science, varies, not only according to a man's degree of
intellectual cultivation, but according to his social condition
or profession. The herborist has eyes only for the plants in
which he deals,&mdash;the "simples" which, as we read in old
Gerarde, wrought such wonderful cures in the days of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
forefathers,&mdash;and from the most exquisite flowers he turns
with indifference. The gardener, on the other hand, is
wholly absorbed by his love and his hate,&mdash;his charming
exotics, and his troublesome weeds. The latter he regards
with much the same feelings as a society wholly composed
of honest men would regard an infusion of the "dangerous
elements;" for weeds, like rogues, take what is not their
own, and deprive others of their means of sustenance. But
to classify plants according to their virtues or vices is not
worthy of science, exclaims the rigid botanist. Would you
mingle vile self-interest with the pure study of the vegetable
kingdom? Remember that all selfish feelings ought to be
banished from the sublime sanctuary of analysis and synthesis.</p>

<p>This sounds exceedingly well. Disinterested words, from
whatever quarter they come, always produce&mdash;perhaps, on
account of their comparative rarity&mdash;an admirable effect.
But what is their real value? To ascertain it, the listener
must be able to seize, like so many luminous threads, all
the emotions which are acting upon the heart and tongue
of the speaker. But we are very far from having arrived
at this degree of perfection. Shall we ever attain to it?
Yes, because we can conceive its possibility. But, until
that golden epoch, the pure love of science will always
remain a myth, and we shall not have universally understood
the necessity of seeking in the profound study of
nature the grand destiny of man.</p>

<p>It is among the weeds and noxious plants that we shall
find the species capable of enduring longest the cold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
winter. What part, then, do they fulfil in the economy of
creation? An ambitious, but not a novel question, which
has often been propounded in reference to our parasitical
insects.</p>

<p>The best answer which we can make to it is this: Everything
invites us to work. Labour is imposed even upon
him who least desires it. Earth will yield a return only in
proportion to the care we bestow upon her.</p>

<p>If, after having toiled and sown, we had nothing to do
but to gather in the harvest, every person would become
an agriculturist. But a soil which is not manured will
soon grow exhausted; and if it be neither ploughed nor
harrowed, instead of barley or vegetables, it will soon be
covered with tares; rank weeds will flourish in every field.
Such is the chastisement reserved for sloth,&mdash;the true "original
sin" of the human race.</p>

<p>Well, then, it is among the weeds, everywhere so common,
that we meet with the plants best able to brave the
rigours of frost.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Dog Mercury.</span></p>

<p>The annual <em>Dog Mercury</em> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mercurialis annua</i>) is one of the
most tenacious. It attracts the passer-by, if he condescend
to bestow a glance upon it, only by its extreme abundance;
it propagates very largely, though it is by no means
partial to all localities. For instance, it avoids the woods
as persistently as its congener, the common Dog Mercury
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mercurialis perennis</i>) seeks them. It prefers the vicinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of human habitations and uncultivated fields. If let alone,
it spreads with a dangerous rapidity, and invades every
garden which is not kept in the most exquisite order.
Still, we must not deal too harshly with it. It is not
altogether unfriendly to man. In truth, owing to its laxative
properties, it renders him invaluable services. The country
people have great faith in fomentations of Dog Mercury
and honey. Understand, we pray you, that not an atom of
mercury enters into it, despite its significant name; but a
decoction of the annual Dog Mercury, mixed with a little
thick honey, answers all the purposes of those lenitive
clysters which are so beneficial to excitable temperaments.
The leaves of the plant are eaten in Germany like spinach.</p>

<p>Of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mercurialis perennis</i> Mr Sowerby writes:&mdash;"This
plant was formerly used in medicine, but has long been
abandoned as a remedy. It is extremely acrid, and even
poisonous, though recommended in some old books as a
good pot-herb, probably from being confounded with the
annual species. When steeped in water, the leaves give
out a fine blue colour resembling indigo. This colouring
matter is turned red by acids, and destroyed by alkalis,
but is otherwise permanent; it might possibly prove valuable
as a dye, if any means could be discovered of fixing
it, and the herb has been introduced into this work with
the view of drawing the attention of chemists to the subject;
no experiments seem to have been lately made upon it."</p>

</div>

<p>Let us now advise you how to distinguish our medicinal
plant from the "ill weeds" with which it loves to associate.
Its ovate, rough, irregularly-dentated, and petiolated leaves
would not give it a sufficiently marked character, had it no
other features peculiar to itself. But observe the yellowish-green
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">glomerules</i>, arranged, like millet, on a long frail spike.
(Fig. 18, <i>a</i>.) They exhale, as your nose will inform you, a
peculiar aroma, like that of spiced bread: no other plant
but our Dog Mercury is gifted with this odour. Now, bring
your magnifying-glass to bear upon it; with the point of a
knife or a feather open one of the grains which form the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">glomerules</i> of the spike; out of it will leap, as if impelled by
an invisible spring, a large number of stamens, easily distinguished
by their elastic thread-like anthers, covered with
tiny yellow beads. Each greenish grain is a <em>flower</em>; the calyx,
which also serves as the corolla, is represented by three little
petals, forming the external envelope of the little flower.
(Fig. 18, <i>b</i>.) But something essential is still wanting; in the
centre of the stamens you do not find any pistil. Why is
so important an organ wanting? Because our little rounded
flowers, with their spice-bread odour, have but one sex, are
<em>unisexual</em>; they are male flowers, since they are furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
only with stamens. In vain do you hunt on the same stem
for their companions, the female flowers. You will find them
only upon <em>other</em> stems, distinct from those which bear the
male flowers. The Dog Mercury, then, is a plant whose two
sexes are lodged in two different houses, οἴκοι&mdash;is, in fact, a
<em>dioecious</em> species.</p>

<p>But you are sure to find the female flowers in the immediate
neighbourhood of the stems with the male flowers.
They are easily recognised by their larger and darker leaves
(Fig. 18, <i>c</i>); and especially by their little twin pods, green,
wrinkled, and pedicellate,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> which garnish the axil of the
leaves. (Fig. 18, <i>d</i>.) From this characteristic the female
mercury was formerly mistaken for the <em>male</em>; and many
centuries elapsed before naturalists recognised, what now-a-days
seems so simple, that the little pods, joined in couples,
and containing each a grain, composed the <em>fruit</em> of a single
plant; that every fruit proceeds from an ovary; and that every
ovary is a sign of the feminine sex.</p>

<p>In the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Historia Naturalis</i> of Pliny, who was at once so
acute and so credulous an observer, we first meet with the
name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mercurialis</i>.</p>

<p>"The plant is so denominated," he says,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> "because it was
discovered by Mercury. Its juice, mingled with that of the
<em>hibiscus</em> (a species of the <em>Malvaceæ</em>) and the purslain, forms
a kind of unguent, with which, if you thoroughly rub the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
hands, they can touch molten lead without being injured."</p>

<p>The description which Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> gives of the <em>Linozosis</em>,
which he also calls <em>Parthenion</em>, or <em>Mercury's Plant</em> (Ἑρμου
βοτάνιον) applies, in the main, to our Dog Mercury. It is
true that its leaves "are not like those of the basilic" (φίλλα ὄμοια ὁκίμῳ);
but they resemble in all respects those of the
smooth variety of cultivated mint; and, apparently, the basilic
of Dioscorides was one of our mints. The fruit of the female,
he adds,&mdash;evidently meaning the male flowers,&mdash;are disposed
in clusters.</p>

<p>Both species of the Herb or Dog Mercury belong to the
family <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Euphorbiaceæ</i>.</p>

<p>Our attention must now be directed to another point. It
is a fact, that in winters of moderate severity the Mercury continues
to infest our gardens and cultivated fields. It only
succumbs to a frost equal to six to ten degrees below freezing-point;
then its congealed stem totters, and grows black, and
its leaves mingle so completely with the soil that it is difficult
to discover any vestiges.</p>

<p>How singular a contrast! The plants most destructive in
our kitchen gardens are frequently the most useful in medicine.
There are no drugs more popular than the weeds which we
call Herb Mercury, Garden Nightshade, and Dog's-tooth
grass. All belong to families whose properties are strongly
marked. As already stated, the Mercury ranks among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Euphorbiaceæ</i>, remarkable for their acrid and more or less
purgative juice. In this family occur the most violent
drastics, such as the <em>Croton tiglium</em>, whose oil (expressed
from the seeds) has long been considered an efficacious
medicine. The Garden Nightshade is one of the <em>Solanaceæ</em>,
and cousin-german of the useful potato; and the
Dog's-tooth grass, whose roots compose three-fourths of
our possets, is of the same family as our cereals.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Garden Nightshade.</span></p>

</div>

<p>If you have seen&mdash;and who has not?&mdash;the flowers of the
potato-plant, you will immediately recognise the flowers of the Garden
or Black Nightshade. (Fig. 19.) This noxious herb&mdash;noxious in
some, but useful in other respects, and, therefore, not to be visited
with too hasty a condemnation&mdash;flowers and fructifies throughout
the year. Its fertility is extreme; only the severest winter-frosts can
crush out its prolific life. The fruits which succeed to the flowers
are smaller berries or "apples" than those of the potato. (See Fig.
20.)</p>

<p>In the history of botany, and even in that of philosophy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the Black Nightshade (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum nigrum</i>) has a certain interest.
Thus, says M. Hoefer, both Cordus and Jean Bauhin,
botanists of the sixteenth century, have described the flower
of this plant as if its corolla were composed of five distinct
petals.</p>

<p>Where were the eyes of those great botanists? The corolla of the
nightshade, like that of all the <em>Solanaceæ</em>, is plainly and
obviously monopetalous,&mdash;that is, composed of a single piece; to
assure yourself of this, you have but to open it out. (See Fig. 21,
<i>b</i>.) It was the sharp-pointed, ovate divisions of the limb
which imposed on the old observers; a fresh proof that <em>seeing</em>
and <em>observing</em> are two very distinct things. Our vision enters
into full exercise from earliest infancy; observation is not acquired
until after much labour and many years.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="250" height="195" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Do not forget to add, that the five stamens are brought very closely
together by their elongated anthers, as is also seen in the flower of
the potato-plant. (Fig. 21, <i>a</i>.)</p>

<p>The same botanists who took our solanum for a plant with a
polypetalous corolla, considered the Bitter-sweet (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum dulcamara</i>)
to be a metamorphosis of the Garden Nightshade! The former they
christened the red-berried solanum (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum baccis rubris</i>), and the
latter, the black-berried solanum (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum baccis nigris</i>).</p>


<p class="p1a">But if we once launch into the hypothetical, we shall be
unable to stop half-way. If the species of one and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
same genus are the result of a transformation, why may
we not assert as much of the genera of a family, or the
families of an order?</p>

<p>Thus we should arrive, step by step, at an unique type,
not only for the vegetable kingdom, but for vegetables and
animals, including man himself, and realise, to some extent,
the ideal of the Greeks,&mdash;<em>unity in variety</em>.</p>

<p>Be it acknowledged, however, that <em>we</em> have no desire to
rise to so lofty an elevation. The potato-plant&mdash;unknown
to the ancients, inasmuch as it is a native of the New
World&mdash;has not been found to lose its character since its
introduction into the ancient continent; its congener, the
nightshade&mdash;an old native, like every bad herb&mdash;accompanies
it everywhere; but its fibrous roots are absolutely
virgin of every farinaceous tubercule.</p>

<p>Though the nightshade is common everywhere, Tournefort
was the first to describe it with complete accuracy. That
great observer even specifies various peculiarities which most
of our botanists omit from their descriptions. Thus, he
rightly remarks, that the peduncles branch out so as to
form a kind of umbel, and do not emerge, as is usually
the case, from the axils of the leaves, but a little below,
from the very branches of the stem. He was also the first
to note&mdash;and it was a veritable discovery&mdash;that the white
flowers of the nightshade, grouped in threes to eights, are
each formed of a single cup-shaped leaf,&mdash;in other words,
that the corolla is monophyllous, and slightly bell-like or
campanulated. Nor does he forget to describe the disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the five stamens, set close around the pistil, which,
as it develops, forms a globular bacciform fruit, embraced
by a five-lobed calyx. This fruit, which changes in colour
from green to black, is filled with a great number of grains
in a thick liquid, exhaling a nauseous odour. As for the
leaves, they resemble those of spinach, for which, in some
countries, they serve as a substitute.</p>

<p>Like all plants found by the wayside, and among heaps
of refuse, the nightshade loves to vary its form, and of its
various forms some nomenclators have made as many different
species. The typical variety, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum nigrum</i>,
has glabrous stems and leaves, that is, they are covered
with short, but hardly visible hairs; its berries are black.</p>

<p>The smooth variety, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum villosum</i>, is rather rare,
and has swollen or bulging leaves and stems; its berries
are red or of a reddish yellow. The two varieties seem
able, by sowing, to be transformed into one another. A
sub-variety of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum villosum</i> has been described as
a peculiar species, under the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum miniatum</i>,
so named on account of its vermilion-coloured berries. The
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum ochroleucum</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum luteovirens</i>, the first with
yellowish, and the second with greenish berries, are simply
varieties, and the same may be said of the dwarf form,
known by the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum humile</i>.</p>

<p>But the physician is more interested in the solanum than
either the gardener or botanist. For him it is no useless or
noxious weed, but, on the contrary, is an eminently precious
herb. And, in fact, if it possessed only one-half the virtues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
formerly attributed to it, we ought to bow to the ground
every time we encounter it.</p>

<p>Listen to our authorities even if you do not respect them.</p>

<p>Cæsalpin asserts that the decoction or juice of the nightshade
is a sovereign remedy for complaints of the stomach
and the bladder, and regards nightshade-water, mixed with
an equal quantity of absinthe-water, as one of the best
sudorifics.</p>

<p>Tragus, a physician and botanist like Cæsalpin, recommends
the juice of the nightshade as anti-choleraic, as well
as efficacious in inflammation of the liver and stomach.
And yet, at the same time, he grows emphatic in reference
to its poisonous properties. "Do not," he says, "employ
this herb immoderately, lest it should happen to you as,
in 1541, I saw it happen to an inhabitant of Erbach, near
Hohenburg. After having eaten a few nightshade-berries, he
was seized, on the following day, by a furious monomania,
which led his neighbours to believe him possessed of a
devil. After having uselessly employed every kind of
exorcism, they sent for me. I made my patient swallow
some very strong wine; he fell into a profound slumber;
and, when he awoke, was cured."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Withering affirms that a couple of grains of the dried leaves
will act as a powerful sudorific, and that they have also been
found useful in some cutaneous disorders.</p>

<p>Here is another authority, before whom naturalists are
accustomed to give way. We make use of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nigrum</i>, says Tournefort,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> when it is necessary to subdue
inflammation, or soften and relax the fibres. The pounded
herb is applied to hæmorrhoids. The juice, with a sixth-part
of rectified spirit-of-wine, is advantageous in cases of
erysipelas, ringworm, wildfire, and all diseases of the skin.
Nightshade is also employed in anodyne cataplasms.</p>


<p class="p1a">Tournefort did not confine himself to simple botanical descriptions;
he did, what our modern botanists neglect doing,&mdash;he
made experiments, both physiological and chemical, on
the plants employed in medicine. Thus, he began by tasting
the different parts of the plant.</p>

<p>"The root," he says, "is almost insipid; the leaves taste
like a saltish herb; there is something sharp and vinegary in
the fruit; the whole plant has a narcotic odour. The <em>leaves</em>
do not redden turnsole,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> but the ripe <em>fruit</em> reddens it greatly;
whence we may conjecture that the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sal-ammoniac</i> contained
in this plant is moderated in the leaves by a very considerable
portion of f&oelig;tid oil and earth, but that the acid portion
of the salt is strongly developed in the ripe fruit; so
that we must choose our part of the plant according to the
purposes we wish to employ it for. The fruits, for instance,
are more refreshing, but more repellant, than the leaves, which
soften while resolving, cleansing, and absorbing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>We admit that these data leave much to be desired from
a chemical point of view. We may well ask, for example, how
the illustrious philosopher ascertained the presence of sal-ammoniac
in nightshade? But it is not fair to criticise the
science of the past, by judging it through the deceitful prism
of the science of to-day. We must adopt the methods of our
predecessors, when discussing natural productions from all the
view-points of their applications.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Dog's-tooth Grass.</span></p>

<p>In clearing an uncultivated field we uproot a great number
of herbaceous plants of different families; but those of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gramineæ</i>, or Grasses, invariably predominate. They are the
trailing roots, or <em>rhizomes</em>, of certain species which have been
included under the general denomination of Dog's-tooth.
These tenacious and vigorous roots,&mdash;so wholesome in various
maladies, so injurious to cultivation,&mdash;are, whatever certain
botanists may say, far from tracing their origin in all cases
to the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Triticum repens</i> (couch-grass) and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Panicum dactylon</i>&mdash;those
terrible enemies of the corn-field, which, once established
in the soil, are with difficulty extirpated, and prove
very injurious to the "golden crops." Nearly every grass
which puts forth <em>rhizomes</em> will furnish the <em>Dogs-tooth</em>. We may
cite, for instance, several species of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Festuca</i> (as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Festuca rubra</i>
and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Festuca pinnata</i>), or fescue grass; at least two kinds of
meadow grass (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Poa compressa</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Poa pratensis</i>), a species of
wild-oats (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Avena elatior</i>), to say nothing of the weeds <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arundo
phragmites</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arundo epigeios</i>. The long <em>rhizomes</em> of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
vivacious plants possess nearly the same properties, due to
their saccharine principles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_106.jpg" width="424" height="550" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;A Corn-field.</p></div>
</div>

<p>How shall we distinguish these plants from one another?
Their leaves have almost exactly the same configuration; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
are linear;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and their flowers are not apparent,&mdash;they do not
attract the gaze of the passer-by. Yet they possess all the
organs necessary for the reproduction of their species:&mdash;three
stamens, each composed of an anther and a characteristic
filament; on this anther, whose two lobes are arranged like
the branches of an X, the pistil softly and tenderly balances
itself on the summit of a frail thread, to which it is attached
by the back. Remark, too, the two styles with feathery
stigmata,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> like the barbs of feathers. Nothing is wanting
to constitute a complete flower.</p>

<p>There is even a perianth, or calyx, represented by a couple
of tiny membraneous scales, scientifically known as <em>glumellulæ</em>;
then at the base of each spikelet, composed of one or two
of these bright green lilliputian flowers, are two other and
larger scales, called <em>glumellæ</em>: they represent an <em>involucre</em>.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
It is almost unnecessary to add, that the free, unilocular
ovary, or seed vessel, forms, as a result of its development,
the seed, whose embryo adheres laterally to a farinaceous
kernel, or <em>perisperm</em>. The union of one or more of these
flowers composes a spikelet, and the union of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">spikelets</i>
constitutes the spike, which may be disposed on a
simple or ramified axis. Such are, in general, the characters
we must keep before us in the difficult study of the Gramineæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now see, more closely, the two plants which,
according to the botanists, furnish the root of the Dog's-tooth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 457px;">
<img src="images/i_108.jpg" width="457" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>&mdash;A River's Sandy Bank.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When walking along the sandy bank of a river, you must
frequently have trodden under foot a low, almost crawling
herb, remarkable for its violet-red spikes, which, three to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
five in number, are arranged like the fingers of a hand, on
the summit of a short curving stem.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_109.jpg" width="500" height="368" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span>&mdash;(P. 93.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>This glaucous-leaved herb is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Panicum</i> <i xml:lang="el" lang="el">dactylon</i> (<i>i.e.</i>,
fingered-millet) of Linnæus. The long trailing <em>rhizomes</em>,
joined to some less prominent characters, have been sufficient
for some botanists to create a special genus, <i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Cynodon</i>, or
<i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Kynodon</i> (a Greek word, signifying literally "Dog's-tooth"),
and to change the Linnean denomination of our grass into
<i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Cynodon dactylon</i>. It is seldom met with in cultivated land;
but in such a locality as we have already described, and
sometimes on open sandy shores, where the summer sea
comes with a gentle ripple and a subdued music, it may
frequently be found. Its long, tough runners creep through
and over the loose soil for many yards, rooting at every
joint, and furnished with flat, rather short leaves, of a
glaucous hue. The flowers grow in narrow, linear spikes,
arranged at the top of a short leafy stem in the form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
an umbel, and give the grass, when in bloom, a very peculiar
and characteristic aspect.</p>

<p>But if the <i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Cynodon dactylon</i> is rare in cultivated fields,
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Triticum repens</i>&mdash;commonly called couch-grass, but, in
our opinion, the true and genuine dog's-tooth&mdash;is particularly
abundant. (See Fig. 23.) Its long subterranean stems increase
with astonishing rapidity, and if the smallest fragment
be left in the soil, it will vegetate, and speedily extend
itself, until it becomes almost impossible to extirpate it.
It is a kind of wild barley, with stiff leaves of a moderate
length, and of a bluish tint, and a double spike, composed
of clusters of four to six flowers, each crowned by a narrow
ridge. We must not confound the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Triticum repens</i> with the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Elymus caninus</i> of Linnæus, which has no trailing underground
roots like the former. It differs also from the
latter in the roughness of <em>each</em> side of its leaves,&mdash;only one
side of the leaf of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Triticum repens</i> being rough,&mdash;and in
the crests which rise above the flowers.</p>

<p>Was the dog's-tooth known to the ancients? Undoubtedly,
for the dog's-tooth flourishes in all climates,&mdash;is truly
cosmopolitan. But it is difficult to decide whether their
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agrostis</i> and their <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gramen</i> apply to the above-mentioned
species.</p>


<p class="p1a">According to Diodorus, the primitive Egyptians lived
upon herbs. "They also eat," he says,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> "the stems and
roots which grow in the marshes. Especially did they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
hunt after the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agrostis</i>, a plant remarkable for its sweet
savour and the sufficient nourishment which it offers to
the wants of man. It is likewise considered an excellent
provision for cattle, from its fattening properties. It is in remembrance
of these benefits that the inhabitants of Egypt,
when worshipping their gods, carry this plant in their
hand."</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agrostis</i> of Diodorus would apply to all the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Graminaceæ</i>
whose stems and roots contain nutritive and saccharine principles.
Let us here remind the reader that the sugar-cane
belongs to the same family as barley and the dog's-tooth.</p>

<p>Pliny is much more explicit. What he says of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gramen</i>
(or grass), the "commonest of herbs"&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">inter herbas vulgatissimum</i>&mdash;and
of the geniculated spaces between its knots
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">geniculatis serpit internodiis</i>), applies with tolerable accuracy
to our <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Triticum repens</i>. He also speaks of the diuretic properties
of a decoction from its trailing roots.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> As for his
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gramen aculeatum</i> (or needle-like grass), it is positively our
<i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Cynodon dactylon</i>. "The five spurs or needles which shoot
out," he says, "from the top of the stem, have procured it
the name of <i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Dactylon</i>." To these digitiform spikes he attributes
the property of checking the bleeding of the nose, when
they are introduced into the nostrils. But a thorn is much
better fitted to produce this effect; the spikes of the digitated
panicle of the <i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Cynodon dactylon</i> are much too soft to determine
epistaxis by a mechanical action. So it is not improbable
that they owe their putative virtue to their colouring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which is not unlike that of blood, and which has even procured
for the species the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Digitaria sanguinalis</i>. In
the same manner the capricious mediæval imagination pronounced
liverwort, with its marbled leaves, a sovereign
remedy for diseases of the lungs,&mdash;organs remarkable for
their marbled appearance.</p>

<p>Dioscorides is quite as explicit as Pliny. What the latter
names <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gramen</i>, he, however, calls <i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Agrostis</i>. After having
particularised the nodosities of the stem&mdash;a feature common
to nearly all the Graminaceæ&mdash;he describes very clearly the
long creeping roots put forth by the said stem; and
he does not forget to mention the sugary savour, so characteristic
of the rhizomes (&#8165;&#8055;&#950;&#945;&#962; &#947;&#955;&#965;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#962;) of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Triticum
repens</i>.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Theophrastus confines himself to indicating the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agrostis</i> as a herb which infests the fields.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>


<p class="p1a">The <i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Cynodon dactylon</i> is, at the present day, very common
in Greece, where it is specially partial to low grounds, which
are somewhat damp and sandy. The inhabitants call it
<em>Agriada</em>, a name derived from &#7940;&#947;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;, "wild." But if we
may believe Fraas, the author of a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Flora Classica</i>, the genuine
dog's-tooth, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Triticum repens</i>, is, on the contrary, very rare in
the land of Socrates. This is a curious fact, if a fact, for
geographical botany.</p>

<p>Throughout the Middle Ages, and down to the eighteenth
century, were confounded, under the generic name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gramina</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
or grasses, the most diversely-featured herbs, including the
dog's-tooth. Tabernæmontanus, Dodonné, Mathiole, Jean
and Gaspard Bauhin, were the first to attempt the clearing
of a path through this intricate wilderness. They eulogised,
at the same time, the emollient properties of the dog's-tooth.</p>

<p>Tournefort<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and Bernard de Jussieu, who appear to have
made a chemical analysis of it, pretend that the roots of
the dog's-tooth contain a large quantity of oil, earth, and
several acid liquids, as well as a little fixed salt. "According
to all appearance," they add, "the roots act by means
of a salt analogous to salt of coral, enveloped in a great
deal of sulphur."</p>

<p>Instead of mocking us with such fantastic analyses, which
can only excite the laughter of our modern chemists, Tournefort
and Bernard de Jussieu would have deserved better of
science if they had applied themselves to the task of introducing
light and order into the cloudy chaos of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Graminaceæ</i>
of the botanists of their age.</p>


<p class="p1a">But winter is passing away, and the time for the singing
of birds is at hand. Already the earth is awakening from
her prolonged lethargy; the hedgerows are green with budding
leaves; the purple crocuses shine in many a sheltered
field; on bank and brae, in glen and vale, the glory of the
primrose makes glad the heart of man; the wood anemone
hangs its delicate head in the woodlands; and it seems as
if a gladder feeling animated the universal nature.</p>

<span class="hidden">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> may be doubted whether many of the patrons
of Mudie's are acquainted with the works of a
philosopher, who, in his day, enjoyed no little
fame&mdash;I mean, Robert Boyle (1627-1691),&mdash;and yet
there are passages in them well worth attentive perusal,
from the lucidity of their style and the soundness of
their reflections. He has, for instance, some observations
in his "Considerations on the Usefulness of
Experimental Philosophy," which are germane to the
general purport and tone of our little book. He remarks,
that the contemplation of the vastness, beauty,
and regular motions of the heavenly bodies, the excellent
structure of animals and plants, besides a multitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of other phenomena of nature, and the subserviency of
most of these to man, ought, certainly, to induce him, as a
rational creature, to conclude that this vast, beautiful, orderly,
and, in a word, many ways admirable, system of things, that
we call the world, was framed by an Author supremely powerful,
wise, and good.</p>

<p>The works of God, he adds, are so worthy of their Author,
that, besides the impresses of His wisdom and goodness that
are left, as it were, upon their surfaces, there are a great many
more curious and excellent tokens and effects of Divine artifice
in the hidden and innermost recesses of them; and these
are not to be discovered by the perfunctory looks of oscitant
and unskilful beholders; but require, as well as deserve, the
most attentive and prying inspection of inquisitive and well-instructed
considerers. It is not by a slight survey, but by a
diligent and skilful scrutiny of the works of God, that a man
must be, by a rational and affective conviction, engaged to
acknowledge, with the prophet, that the Author of nature is
"wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working."</p>

<p>That He is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working
must be the conclusion of every devout student of the celestial
phenomena; and to those we shall, therefore, devote the first
portion of our Spring meditations.</p>

<p>As for men of science, they would not have condescended
to honour even with a smile such strange and fantastic words.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, now, that our poetical astronomer, thus
contemned, had addressed his scientific censors in some such
language as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Do not think, illustrious sirs, that it is by a purely poetical
licence I call the firmament a mirror in which the earth may
be seen reflected. Only, to prevent all equivoque, we must
understand one another. The mirror to which I am alluding
does not reflect <em>light</em>, but <em>movement</em>. It is in a particular
movement of the stars that the true figure of our planet is
reflected, is revealed to us. But before the human mind can
appreciate this movement,&mdash;especially before it can discover
the cause,&mdash;we must be prepared to devote ourselves to centuries
of assiduous effort. In this long interval, philosophers
of every class will allow unrestricted scope to their imagination.</p>

<p>Shall we, then, recall some of these opinions,&mdash;some of
these truly poetical licences?</p>

<p>Homer and Hesiod represented the earth as a disc, or as
a flat rondel, surrounded on all sides by a winding river which
they called the Ocean, and which, in the extreme East, communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
with the Phasis, in Colchis. Above this terrestrial
disc the outspread sky was arched like a vast dome; a dome
supported by two massive pillars, resting on the shoulders of
the god Atlas.</p>

<p>Surely the ancient poets must have evolved the earth-disc
from their own prolific imagination. Can they never have seen
a far-off vessel, showing, as it approached them, at first the
tops of its masts, then its swelling sails, and finally its hull?
They might have made so simple an observation in any seaport;
if they did, why did it not suggest to them the idea
that the earth, instead of being level, must be round? Because
it is easier to let the imagination speak than the
reason.</p>

<p>The fiction of the earth-disc remained long unshaken, with
the exception of a few modifications. Thales figured to himself
the earth as floating on a humid element. And, six centuries
later, we find Seneca still adopting the opinion of the
Greek philosopher. "This humid element (<em>humor</em>)," he says,
"which sustains the disc of the earth like a ship, may be,
perhaps, the ocean, or a liquid of simpler nature than water."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>But how, then, was the rising or setting of the stars explained?
The ancients supposed that they were extinguished
at sunset, and rekindled at sunrise. Thus, an unfounded
hypothesis has for its consequence a still more baseless
hypothesis; and in this manner we glide down the slope of
fiction to fall eventually into an abyss of contradictions.
Such is the true punishment of error.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us continue.&mdash;According to the Chaldeans, who were
thought to be profoundly versed in astronomy, the earth was
hollow, and shaped like an egg-shell. And,&mdash;adds Diodorus,
from whom we have this detail,&mdash;they adduce numerous and
plausible proofs of this assertion.</p>

<p>Yet was this idea in direct opposition to the evidence of our
senses when we travel over a wide plain, or navigate the great
deep; at least, unless we admit that the earth has the form of
a reversed egg-shell, with its convex face uppermost, and its
concave one beneath. Heraclitus of Ephesus introduced the
Chaldean doctrine into Greece.</p>

<p>Anaximander represents the earth as a cylinder, whose
upper face alone is inhabited. This cylinder, adds the philosopher,
is a third of its diameter in height, and floats freely in
the midst of the celestial vault, because there is no reason
why it should move more to one side than the other. Leucippus,
Democritus, Heraclitus, and Anaxagoras,&mdash;names of high
repute in the history of philosophy,&mdash;adopted Anaximander's
system, though it was neither more nor less than a wild
phantasy.</p>

<p>Anaximenes and Zenophanes, without pronouncing dogmatically
on the form of the earth, represented it as resting,&mdash;the
one upon compressed air, the other upon roots which
were prolonged <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. But upon what was the compressed
air supported? And of what nature were these mysterious
roots?</p>

<p>Plato, with a nearer approximation to the probable, gave
to the earth the form of a cube. The cube, bounded by six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
square equal surfaces, appeared to him the most perfect
geometrical solid, and consequently the most suitable for the
earth, supposed to be the centre of the universe.</p>

<p>Eudoxes, who, in his long travels in Greece and Egypt,
must have seen new constellations rising in the south, while
others disappeared in the north, never ventured to adduce from
his astronomical observations the sphericity of the earth.</p>

<p>Aristotle, bolder than Eudoxes, was led to the conception
of this sphericity by simple consideration of mechanics. The
earth, he said, must be a sphere, because each particle of matter
is carried, by gravity, towards the centre; and as this fact is
general, the superficial particles must be at an equal distance
from the centre. This theoretical view was adopted by Archimedes,
who applied it to the waters covering the terrestrial surface.
Aristotle went further; he saw the rotundity of the earth
in the shadow thrown by the latter on the bright face of the
moon during its eclipses.</p>

<p>It is a noteworthy fact that the arguments of Aristotle,
founded on a method to which all the progress of science is
due, remained unaccepted for two thousand years. And why?</p>

<p>We shall attempt to explain.</p>

<p>Among those subjects whose comprehension seems to have
been specially difficult to the mind of man, we must include
the fact that the earth floats without any solid support in the
infinity of space, and carries its denizens on its surface, both
above and below.</p>

<p>Our creeds, which have ever pretended to explain everything
in the physical as well as in the moral order, have here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
endeavoured to come to the assistance of the weakness of the
human mind. And as each creed asserts itself to be the best,
to the exclusion of every other, men began to imagine for the
earth a navel, and placed it where it was supposed pleasing
to the divinity.</p>

<p>The Greek priests dismissed a couple of eagles, one towards
the west, the other towards the east; the place where these
favourite birds of Jove, of the "Father of gods and men,"
encountered each other, was to be considered the "navel"
of the earth. It chanced to be Delphos, whose oracle was
the most esteemed in the ancient world; the sacerdotal caste
accumulated there immense wealth. The Greek priests prudently
refrained from dealing with the difficult problem of the
earth's solid support.</p>


<p class="p1a">The Hebrew pontiffs, however, were not so reserved.
After having made Jerusalem the "navel of the world,"
they allowed for the earth itself seven solid columns as a
foundation. The question of the Antipodes, in which the
greatest intellects of antiquity believed,&mdash;Pythagoras, Plato,
and Aristotle,&mdash;was thus pontifically judged and condemned.
And Christians who preferred to follow the Judaical observance
of external ceremonies to a true comprehension of the
spirit of the Gospels, exaggerated the application of this
sentence.</p>


<p class="p1a">The dogmatic condemnation of the existence of the Antipodes
long arrested man in his search for that fourth quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of the world whose inhabitants should have their feet directed towards
ours. It was one of the principal obstacles which Columbus was called
upon to surmount in the realisation of his sublime idea. When cited
before the Council of Salamanca,&mdash;composed of prelates and men of
science,&mdash;he had to meet the revived objection of Lactantius, a
Christian apologist of the third century:<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>&mdash;"Can there be anything
more absurd than a belief in the existence of Antipodes,
of inhabitants with their feet opposite to our feet,
of people who walk with their feet in the air, and their
heads on the ground?&mdash;that there is a part of the world
where everything is inverted, where trees throw out their
branches from top to bottom, while it rains, and hails, and
snows, from bottom to top?"</p>

<p>Columbus admirably demonstrated, from an artificial globe,
that flies walked as easily on the lower as on the upper surface,
and hence pointed out that men, compared with the
size of the earth, are much smaller still than flies. But his
judges persisted in their conviction, and did not fail to cast in
his face the jesting words of Plutarch: "Philosophers, rather
than renounce a favourite hypothesis, would make human
beings crawl on the lower face of the earth like worms or
lizards." But it was principally the authority of St Augustine
which they invoked to condemn a belief in the Antipodes.
St Augustine had declared such a belief incompatible
with the dogmas of the faith; for to admit the existence of
inhabitable lands, in the opposite hemisphere, would be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
admit the existence of peoples not descended from Adam,
since it would have been impossible for him to traverse the
ocean lying between Asia and the Antipodes!</p>


<p class="p1a">Some authorities denied the Antipodes on the ground
taken by certain classic writers, that the regions of the
opposite hemisphere were uninhabitable under the tropics,
on account of the extreme heat, and near the Poles, on
account of the extreme cold. Others cited Epicurus, affirming
that the earth was inhabitable and roofed with a celestial
vault only in our western hemisphere, the other half being
an inaccessible chaos. Others pretended that no traveller
could reach the east by way of the west, because the
earth, being pear-shaped, he would encounter on his road
an insurmountable tuberosity,&mdash;undoubtedly the tail or stalk
of the pear! Finally, there were some who dwelt upon the
magnitude of the earth, whose circuit would occupy a voyage
of upwards of three years.</p>

<p>It was to this objection, as the most serious, that Columbus
principally addressed his reply. And he replied by discovering
the New World. But had not this daring genius been
supported in his projects by the Spanish sovereigns, Ferdinand
and Isabella, he would have been handed over to
the Inquisition, and condemned as a heretic. It was then
so dangerous to believe in the Antipodes, that a Bishop
of Salzburg was deposed from his episcopal throne, and
deprived of his ecclesiastical dignity, by the Pope Zacharias,
for having countenanced the heresy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>We now know why, for a whole series of centuries, men
would not follow in the footsteps of Aristotle, who was the
first to establish theoretically the sphericity of the earth.</p>

<p>The discovery of the New World, and the voyages of
circumnavigation which rapidly succeeded one another,
demonstrated, not only that inhabitants there are whose
feet are opposite to ours, but that the earth does not rest
upon any species of support; that it floats, like a star, freely
in space.</p>

<p>The ice was broken. The question of the earth's figure
was revived, and, this time, discussed in a new light.</p>

<p><em>Is the earth perfectly round?</em></p>

<p>Copernicus never doubted it; he who was the first, after
Pythagoras, to represent our planet as revolving round the
sun. The geometrical sphericity of the earth wonderfully
harmonised with the perfect circles in which he supposed
the planets to move. Kepler, who had first laid a sacrilegious
hand on the holy figure of the circle, and on the
circular orbits of the stars, never ventured, however, to
dispute the perfect rotundity of the earth; it appeared to
him a matter beyond all controversy. Galileo was the first
to hazard a doubt. But this doubt became a certainty only
through the labours of Huygens.</p>


<p class="p1a">Galileo, who died in the very year that Newton was born
(1642), had discovered, as we know, that all bodies, in
falling, obey an uniformly accelerative force, called <em>gravitation</em>,
and that the space traversed increases as the square of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the time occupied in their descent. Huygens perceived
that gravity varies according to the parallels of latitude,
and it was not long before he demonstrated, by the number
of oscillations which a pendulum of a certain length performs
in a certain time, that it diminishes in a regular ratio
as we approach the Equator, where it reaches its <em>minimum</em>,
and that it augments, on the contrary, in due proportion as
we approach the Poles, where it must attain its <em>maximum</em>.
Strong in this knowledge, and knowing, moreover, that the
material molecules, uniformly distributed in the volume of
a sphere, act upon a point of its surface as if they were
all reunited in the centre of that sphere, Huygens deduced
from it the inequality of the equatorial and the polar radius;
he attempted even to determine how much the former exceeded
the latter. We know, now-a-days, that this difference
is 139,670 feet (41,848,380&mdash;41,708,710 feet).</p>

<p>Newton admits, with Huygens, that the earth bulges out
at the Equator and is flattened at the Poles; that, in a
word, it is a spheroid of revolution. He went much farther:
he made the precession of the Equinoxes depend upon this
flattening; but he did not furnish its mathematical demonstration.
What has been the result? A free skirmishing
ground for all opinions.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Sir Isaac Newton.</p></div>
</div>

<p>While Newton maintained that the form of the earth was
that of a spheroid flattened at the poles, as a necessary
sequence of the great natural law which bears his name,
Jacques Cassini declared himself in favour of an elongated
spheroid. The difference between these two illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
teachers originated a controversy which lasted for upwards
of fifty years. The Academy of Sciences of Paris pronounced,
not unnaturally, in favour of the opinion of their
colleague, though it was far from having the authority of
Dominique Cassini, father of Jacques, and, still less, that
of the illustrious President of the Royal Society of London.
But patriotic ardour supplemented the weakness of their
arguments. The flattened spheroid and Newton's law were
rejected by France, because they were an English invention.
Undoubtedly, no one <em>openly</em> acknowledged so paltry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a reason, but it was certainly true as a sentiment. As everybody
knows, it was Voltaire who first removed the prohibition,
and popularised the Newtonian philosophy in France.</p>

<p>How did our astronomers finally succeed in demonstrating
mathematically the veritable form of our planet?</p>

<p>To obtain a clear and accurate conception, we are obliged
to transport ourselves back two thousand years. Let us
recall, in the first place, that, owing to the diurnal movement,
all the stars progress from east to west; that they
rise and set, to recommence the same rotation. This is
a general and conspicuous fact, which everybody can confirm
for himself. But now for another, whose observation
requires a little more time and patience. During the diurnal
movement, which carries on all the stars and the sun himself,
the latter progresses independently, in the inverse
direction of the celestial vault, as a fly might do upon a
revolving globe. But this second fact is complicated with
a third: While advancing on his own account, from west
to east, the circle which the sun traverses is not parallel
to the Equator; the radiant luminary transports himself
alternatively into the northern and southern hemispheres,
accomplishing this rotation in 365 days and a fraction of a
day, in an oblique plane, which cuts that of the Equator
under an angle of about 23&frac12;&deg;.</p>


<p class="p1a">Let us here take advantage of a parenthesis to explain a
few astronomical technicalities, necessary for the due comprehension
of our subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>It is in the plane, or <em>oblique circle</em>,&mdash;ὁ κῦκλος λοξός;, as
Ptolemæus called it,&mdash;that eclipses occur, owing to the relative
positions of the sun, earth, and moon; and it is for this
reason modern astronomers have denominated it the <em>Ecliptic</em>.
The Ecliptic is the Equator of the <em>oblique sphere</em> (σφαῖρα
ἐγκεκλιμμένη), properly so called, as the Equator is that of the
sphere of the world, or the <em>right sphere</em> (σφαῖρα ὀρθή). The
circles parallel to the Ecliptic, which continue to diminish in
diameter up to the poles of the oblique sphere, bear the
name of <em>parallels of latitude</em>; and we give that of <em>meridians
of longitude</em> or <em>oblique ascensions</em> (ἀναφοραὶ λοξαί) to the great
circles which cut the first rectangularly as they all pass
through the axis and the poles of the Ecliptic. The same
division by circles cutting each other rectangularly has been
made on the right sphere, or sphere of the world. Only,
<em>there</em> the latitudes are named <em>declinations</em>, and the longitudes
<em>right ascensions</em>. The general diurnal movement is a movement
in right ascension; it is measured upon the Equator.
The individual annual movement of the sun is a movement
in longitude; it is measured upon the Ecliptic.</p>

<p>The zone, or belt, which the sun seems to trace in its
annual march, from the limit of its southern excursion (<em>the
winter solstice</em>) to the limit of its boreal excursion (<em>the summer
solstice</em>), and in returning from that limit to the other, after
having twice passed through the equinoctial line (or Equator),&mdash;this
zone is marked on the firmament by a belt of constellations
known as the <em>Zodiac</em>.</p>

<p>These constellations are named, according to the figurative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
grouping of the stars (on which we have commented in
Book I.),&mdash;the Ram, the Bull, the Twins, the Crab, the Lion,
the Virgin, the Balance, the Scorpion, the Archer, the Cow,
the Water-bearer, the Fishes. There are twelve, three for
each season. The constellations represented by these figures,
so singularly chosen, spread over the whole celestial vault,&mdash;that
is, over an extent of 360&deg;.</p>


<p class="p1a">To resume.</p>

<p>The heavens, like earth, have their annals: everything
changes there as in the human world. In the age of Hipparchus,&mdash;or
some two thousand years ago,&mdash;the sun entered,
at the spring equinox, into the zodiacal sign of Aries; in
the summer solstice, it entered into that of Cancer; at the
autumnal equinox, into Libra; and at the winter solstice,
into Capricorn. These signs then corresponded exactly to
the constellations which they represent.</p>

<p>Now, whatever Aristotle and his disciples may say, the
firmament is not incorruptible (&#7936;&#966;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8057;&#962;) and immovable;
even the <em>fixed</em> stars, as we call them, change their place in
time. We have seen that the whole celestial vault or "right
sphere" runs, from east to west, around the poles of the
world; we have seen also that the sun moves, on his own
account, from west to east, around the poles of the oblique
sphere, or the Ecliptic. Well, this does not suffice; there
is a third movement to be observed,&mdash;that of the right sphere
itself round the poles of the Ecliptic; and this, not like that
of the sun, from west to east, but inversely, from east to west.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Only, this movement of the starry sphere in longitude, or
parallel to the plane of the Ecliptic, is extremely slow, compared
with the movement of the same sphere in right ascension,
or parallel to the Equator of the world. While the former
traverses in twenty-four hours the 360&deg; of the circle, the latter
occupies (in round numbers) 25,000 years.</p>

<p>Who was the first discoverer of the slow movement of the
heavens? Hipparchus. This great astronomer, on comparing
his own observations with the more ancient ones of
Aristillus and Timocharis, succeeded in ascertaining that the
constellation which, 150 years before him, corresponded to
the spring equinox, did not, in <em>his</em> time, any longer coincide
exactly with the same equinoctial point, but had outstripped
or preceded it about 2&deg;. This is what we mean by the <em>precession
of the equinoxes</em>.</p>

<p>Hipparchus was at first of opinion that this movement
affected only the constellations of the Zodiac; but he soon
became assured of its universality. He perceived that if it
does not alter the parallels of latitude; because it has occurred
parallel with the Ecliptic, it makes the position of the equinox
retrograde from east to west, and the sun pass slowly through
the same constellations in the reverse of the order in which
he annually traverses them.</p>

<p>We know this movement now to nearly the fraction of a
second. By an inappreciable <em>daily</em> quantity, it rises, at the
end of the year, to 50".3,&mdash;in a century, to about 1&frac12;&deg;,&mdash;in
twenty centuries, to 30&deg;, or the twelfth part of the Zodiac.
It is for this reason the Ram, which, in the days of Hipparchus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was occupied by the sun in spring, has no longer
any value as a commemorative sign; it gives place now-a-days
to the constellation of the Fishes, and corresponds to
the constellation of Taurus, or the Bull; the constellation of
Taurus to Gemini, or the Twins; the constellation of the
Twins to Cancer, and so on. But little more than a month,
then (a month of 2000 years!), of the <em>great year</em> (a year of
25,000 years!) has elapsed since the epoch of Hipparchus. It
is to astronomy especially that, with a slight variation, we may
apply the aphorism of Hippocrates&mdash;"<cite>Brevis vita, ars longa</cite>"
(Life is short, and art long).</p>


<p class="p1a">The precession of the equinoxes explains why the pole of
our starry vault does not occupy invariably the same point of
the firmament, and why the constellations which we now see
shining during the nights of a given season change their
places as time glides by.</p>


<p class="p1a">But what is the cause of this movement?</p>

<p>Before this question, as before a sovereign tribunal, appear
the two opposite doctrines which have been enunciated on
the value of the earth and the sun in the world's system.
According to the doctrine at once the oldest and most intolerant,
the earth occupies immovably the centre of the
world; the sun and the planets are only its satellites; they,
like the moon, revolve around the earth; finally, all the starry
sphere, the whole celestial vault, rotates upon its own axis in
four-and-twenty hours. We have been speaking as if this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
were really and truly the condition of things. If we admit
this doctrine, which bears the name of the Ptolemean system,&mdash;though,
in truth, it is probably as old as humanity itself,&mdash;how
shall we explain the precession of the equinoxes? We
cannot do otherwise than suppose, that while the celestial
sphere executes its diurnal movement round the poles of the
world, it executes another and much slower movement round
the poles of the Ecliptic.</p>

<p>But this assuredly is a most singular supposition. What!
the same starry sphere revolves at one and the same time
parallel to the plane of the Equator, and parallel to another
plane (the Ecliptic) inclined upon the first? After having
imagined eight spheres of crystal to explain the movements
of the moon, the sun, the planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn), and the stars, do we require a ninth?
Where will you stop, if you begin to discover additional
movements? You are condemned to wander from hypothesis
to hypothesis, until you fall into an abyss of contradictions!</p>


<p class="p1a">Such is the language employed by the tribunal of posterity,
in addressing itself to the error which would substitute
appearance for reality.</p>


<p class="p1a">According to the other theory, it is the <em>sun</em> which occupies
the centre of the system, and it is the <em>earth</em> which, accompanied
by the remainder of the planets, revolves around <em>it</em>.
This theory is likewise of considerable antiquity, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
generally known as the <em>Copernican system</em>. But four-and-twenty
centuries prior to the epoch of Nicholas Copernicus,
it was taught by the "Samian sage," Pythagoras, and his
disciples. The system then in acceptance, however, imposed
upon them the necessity of silence. Ptolemæus was acquainted
with it, but endeavoured to turn it into ridicule. "There are
people," he says, "who pretend that heaven is immovable,
and that it is earth which revolves on its own axis; evidently
these individuals are unaware how supremely absurd is their
opinion (πάνμ γελοιότατον)." And it was in the name of
logic and mathematics that Ptolemæus thus treated the
Pythagoreans!</p>

<p>In the system of Copernicus,&mdash;the diurnal movement of
the right sphere,&mdash;it is the earth's rotation upon its own
axis which, being prolonged into the heavens, marks there,
by its extremities, what are called the <em>Poles of the world</em>,
just as the <em>Equator of the world</em> is simply the prolongation
of the terrestrial Equator. As for the Equator of the
oblique sphere (the Ecliptic), in which the sun <em>apparently</em>
moves, it is, in reality, the identical plane in which the
earth moves during its annual revolution round the sun.
Now, in this movement of translation, the axis of the
earth does not remain constantly parallel to itself; it
deviates,&mdash;very slightly, it is true,&mdash;and so as to be scarcely
perceptible to several generations of men. It is then quite
natural that our successors should see, for a long time to
come, the northern pole of the starry sphere near the extremity
of the tail of Ursa Minor. But, two thousand years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
hence, this slow deviation will have become very perceptible;
astronomers will then see the pole of the world in
another constellation, and, as this displacement is continuous,
the prolonged axis of the earth will have traced
on the firmament, in 25,000 to 26,000 years, a circle
parallel to the plane of the Ecliptic, and having for its
centre the pole of that plane. This circle is the base of
a cone whose summit rests upon the earth. (Fig. 27, <i>a</i>.)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="400" height="326" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>But this imaginary defined circle (which appears elliptic on account
of the perspective) is but the mean of a series of oscillations around
the pole of the world, which changes its position, as we have just
shown. (Fig. 27, <i>b</i>.) These oscillations originate in the
circumstance that the axis of the earth inclines alternately forward
and backward, in such wise, that a star, after having approached
the Pole, immediately afterwards recedes from it; they cause the
terrestrial globe to resemble the head of a man who, by an alternation
of gesture, says alternately yes and no. Only, while man (the puppet!)
occupies but a second or two in affirming and denying the same thing,
the earth employs about eighteen years and a half in inclining once
forward to say <em>yes</em> (in Latin, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">adnuere</i>), and once backward to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
<em>no</em> (in Latin, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">abnuere</i>). This is scientifically denominated the
<em>nutation</em> of the earth.</p>


<p class="p1a">Who was the fortunate mortal to discover a phenomenon
so singular? Bradley, the English astronomer; the same
who discovered the <em>aberration of light</em>. It was in the
course of his researches to determine the annual parallax
or distance of the stars that, at an interval of nineteen
years, he made, in 1728, the discovery of the aberration of
light, and, in 1747, that of nutation.</p>

<p>The reader may not be displeased to know under what
circumstances he accomplished the latter discovery. While
observing, for several successive years, the circumpolar stars,
and notably the star &#947; in Draco,&mdash;a constellation situated
between Ursa Major and Ursa Minor (see Fig. 2, p. 9),&mdash;Bradley
noticed that this star changed its position by a movement
constantly directed towards the north, from 1727 to
1736, or for a period of nine years. When it had reached the
latter limit, the star appeared stationary for a moment, and
then retraced its course in a southerly direction. Would it
also occupy a period of nine years to arrive at the limit of
this contrary excursion? Bradley affirmed that it would, and
communicated his prediction to a French astronomer, Le
Monnier.</p>

<p>How was Bradley led to appear in the new character of a seer?</p>

<p>By two special circumstances&mdash;the universality, and the
duration of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>If the star &#947; in Draco had been the only one to direct its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
course towards the north, Bradley would probably have been
led to believe that the Pole exercised upon it a peculiar
attraction; but he perceived that many other stars rose in
like manner towards the Pole with an uniform and constant
march; it was, therefore, more natural to suppose that the
Pole advanced towards <em>them</em>. And what strengthened the
probability of this hypothesis was, that the stars situated in
the neighbourhood of the <em>course</em> of the solstices exhibited a
corresponding displacement. But there was already recognised
as in existence a peculiar movement which explained
the precession of the equinoxes. Was it necessary, therefore,
to suppose a second, a kind of rotatory movement? Newton
had already thought of it, by imagining a nutation, through
which the Pole might alternately rise and sink on the plane
of the Ecliptic in the space of a year. But the displacement
which occurs in that interval is too slight to be perceptible to
observation. There might, therefore, be a reasonable doubt
of the accuracy of Newton's idea.</p>

<p>Bradley resumed the idea of his illustrious compatriot. He
recognised in the northward movement of the stars the effect
of a similar rotation, but one which took much longer in its
accomplishment. By doubling the interval of nine years, to
the term of which he had seen the movement become stationary,
he obtained a period nearly approaching that which
the moon employs in returning to the same nodes. This
coincidence flashed upon him like a ray of light.</p>


<p class="p1a">We must here remind the reader,&mdash;who, we hope, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
weary of our scientific or semi-scientific disquisition,&mdash;that
the lunar nodes,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the points of the Ecliptic through which
the moon passes when it proceeds from south to north (the
ascending node), and from north to south (the descending
node),&mdash;are the analogues of the solar equinoxes; the equatorial
points through which the sun passes on its course from
south to north (the spring equinox), and in returning from
north to south (the autumn equinox),&mdash;points of intersection
whose retrogradation constitutes, as we have seen, the precession
of the equinoxes. Well, the moon's nodes retrograde
in a similar manner by a movement directed from east to
west; only it is a much slower movement. While the equinoxes
are displaced but fifty seconds (50") in a year, the
lunar nodes, during the same period, and in the same direction,
move over a space of 19&deg; 20' 29"; so that, in less
than nineteen years, they have made the complete circuit
of the heavens, to return to exactly the same point, after traversing
360&deg;.</p>


<p class="p1a">Thus, then, we have explained the data on which Bradley
rested his prediction. It was confirmed by Le Monnier, who
observed, in fact, that the star &#947; in Draco, and the neighbouring
stars, observed by Bradley from 1727 to 1736, moving
from south to north, occupied the same period of time, from
1736 to 1745, in accomplishing an equal excursion in a
contrary direction, from north to south. These observations
enabled him to fix approximatively the quantity of the
nutation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>To sum up; it was recognised that the angle made by
the axis of the terrestrial poles with the axis of the poles
of the Ecliptic, far from remaining constantly equal to itself
(the amount was 23&deg; 27' 30" in the middle of the present
century), varies by 0".48 yearly, and that this angle itself
experiences a variation whose mean value is 48" in a century.
It sometimes exceeds this mean value, and sometimes falls
below it, by an amount which rises to nearly 9".65. Thus,
while describing, in an interval of 25,000 to 26,000 years,
its curve around the poles of the Ecliptic, the earth's axis
describes, from east to west, a small ellipsis in the space of
about eighteen and two-third years, and imperceptibly
changes, moreover, its angle of inclination.</p>

<p>But, in fine, what is the true cause of all these movements?</p>

<p>Were the earth a perfect sphere, were all its radii of
equal length, the effect of the universal <em>ponderation</em> would
make itself felt as if all the material molecules were concentrated
at a single point&mdash;the centre; and, apart from this
ponderation, which exercises itself in the direct ratio of
the masses, and in the inverse ratio of the square of the
distances, nothing exists which would sway our globe in
one direction rather than in another,&mdash;no precession of the
equinoxes would take place, the plane of the Ecliptic would
invariably coincide with the plane of the Equator, and an
eternal spring would smile on the fortunate earth. The
dream of the poet would be realised, and light would
spread</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>But, as observation shows, the contrary has taken place,
since, besides its movements of diurnal rotation and annual
revolution, the earth has its mobile axis, which is independently
inclined and displaced. Thus, the material molecules
of the planetary surface are not all at an equal distance
from the centre; and, consequently, the earth is not a
perfect sphere. It is, as D'Alembert has demonstrated,
the bulging, equatorial portion which experiences, owing
to the solar attraction, a retrograde movement, carrying
onward the rest of the globe in a general march, called the
precession of the equinoxes.</p>

<p>But this general movement, as we have seen, is, in itself,
simply the mean of a series of oscillations, which D'Alembert
has also connected with gravitation. He has shown
that the nutation of the earth's axis results from the moon's
attraction on the bulging portion of our globe. Finally, it
has been mathematically demonstrated that the said bulging
portion of the earth produces, under the continuous action
of the sun, the precession of the equinoxes; just as this
portion determines, by its continuous action, the nutation
of the lunar axis. As in this universal ponderation all the
wheelwork of the world catches (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tous les rouages du monde
s'engrènent</i>), and the planets, such as Mars and Venus, must
also have their share in the action, however weak it may
be, we have contrived to render an exact account of the
slow changes of the obliquity of the Ecliptic.</p>

<p>Let us resume. Movement and matter, all is <em>ponderated</em>.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as matter is unequally distributed around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
earth's centre, being flattened at the Poles and bulging at
the Equator, it follows that the sun's enormous weight
makes it vacillate, so that it describes at its axis a cone
around the poles of the plane of its orbit. Its movement
we see in the heavens in the precession of the equinoxes.
But the terrestrial axis traces it tremblingly, because the
moon, owing to its vicinity, exercises a perturbing action
on our planet, which, in its turn, exercises on the moon a
still more energetic influence.</p>

the sun, in its apparent course, crosses the
equinoctial line; the duration of the day, transiently
equal to that of the night, will augment in proportion
as the great luminary describes above our
horizon greater and yet greater arcs of a circle.
Yet this is not the budding, happy, radiant spring

of an earthquake, and not in silence, what wonder and
expectation there would be in all hearts to behold the
miraculous change! But now the silent succession suggests
nothing but necessity. To most men, only the <em>cessation</em> of

<p>We think that the ancients, if they had seriously reflected
upon the important part played by the sun in the economy
of nature; how it is the heart, and spring, and inner power
of every movement and manifestation of life; how it is, as
Sir David Brewster says, the centre and soul of our world,
the lamp that lights it, the fire that heats it, the magnet
that guides and controls it, the fountain of colour, which
gives its azure to the sky, its verdure to the fields, its rainbow-hues
to the gay world of flowers, and the purple light
of love to the marble cheek of youth and beauty;&mdash;we think
that the ancients, if they had thought upon, or had known,
all this, would not have given the earth a chief place in
our system. And that they did so is all the more strange
when we remember that they attributed to the world a
<em>soul</em> (the "soul of the world" is a favourite idea with the
great philosophers of antiquity), and looked upon the
planets as living creatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>But they were swayed by that egotistical instinct which
leads man to refer everything to himself, even the very gods
which he has created after his own image. The Bible
teaches us that there is but one God. Alas! are there not
as many gods as there are men? Does not each of us
create a deity in accordance with his own inclinations, his
mode of thought, his degree of mental culture, the sphere
of his ideas? Is the God of a tolerant philosopher identical
with that of a bigoted fanatic? It is not so much due
to a deceitful appearance, an optical illusion, as to a kind
of innate infatuation, that the human race have come to
consider the planet they inhabit as the centre of the universe.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Causes of the Circulation of the Sap.</span></p>

<p>Let us return to the sap, the life-blood of vegetation.</p>

<p>How is it that its movement does not recommence at
the same time in all plants? Why are some clothed with
leaves when the others are scarcely budding? Wherefore,
in certain genera, do the flowers appear before the
leaves?</p>

<p>Some authorities assert,&mdash;but facts show it to be a purely
gratuitous supposition,&mdash;that the flower, which, with the
fruit, seems to be the goal or object of vegetation, demands
a greater activity on the part of the sap. But, in truth,
many trees and shrubs, such as the poplar, the willow, and
the hazel, flourish at an epoch when the sap is barely aroused
from its protracted lethargy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>These are questions which have still to be answered.</p>

<p>But upon yet another question we may dwell at some
detail. What is the cause of the circulation of the sap?</p>

<p>To the best of our knowledge, this important problem
has never been propounded as it should have been. And
for this reason: all observers who have taken up its consideration
have had in view only the <em>rising sap</em>, and the
cause of its rising. Evidently this is but a <em>part</em> of the
problem. The ascending sap, after undergoing an important
modification in the leaves, becomes the <em>descending</em> sap; just
as the venous blood is transformed, on coming into contact
with the air in the lungs, into arterial blood. It is this
alternative movement of <em>going and coming</em> which constitutes
the circulation both of the sap and the blood, and which
ceases completely only with the life of the plant or the
animal. We must, therefore, bear in mind,&mdash;which has not
been hitherto done,&mdash;these two opposite, yet indissolubly
connected, movements, before we can approach with advantage
the solution of the proposed question.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Science consists in discovering, among the different ways
of looking at things which present themselves to the mind,
the one which appears to explain most clearly the phenomena
submitted to observation. He who doubts the
accuracy of our remark need only join us in reviewing
the different opinions enunciated up to the present time
on the cause of the rise of the sap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Grew, an English botanist, a contemporary of Newton,
and his fellow-member in the Royal Society of London,
attributed the rise of the sap to the play of the utricles of
which the plant is composed. These utricles, he said, maintain
a close intercommunication; through their contraction,
the sap passes from the lower to the upper, and thus arrives
almost at the top of the plant. Grew's authority carried conviction
to the minds of many botanists, particularly to those of
his compatriots. Yet was his opinion altogether imaginary;
the supposed contraction of the utricles does not exist.</p>


<p class="p1a">La Hire, a French botanist, who flourished at the beginning
of the eighteenth century,&mdash;son of the geometrician of
the same name,&mdash;pretended that he could account for the
rise of the sap by the play of the little valves with which
the interior of the sap-vessels was furnished; at the same
time he assigned a very active <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> to the fibres of the
roots. The fibres elevate, he said, the whole column of
superimposed liquid, incessantly introducing, by a kind of
suction, new fluids into the organs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the "play of the little valves, with which
the interior of the sap-vessels is furnished," is a pure invention
of La Hire's. Instead of growing wise by experiment,
he suffered himself to be led astray by a false analogy.
Valves are found in the veins of man and the mammals;
but no one has ever seen the sides of the vessels of a
plant garnished with valves to induce a circulation of the
sap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Mariotte, so well known by his researches into the compressibility
of air, represented the rise of the sap as dependent
upon what he called "the attraction taking place
in the narrow tubes"&mdash;upon what, in fact, we now term
<em>capillarity</em>. "This first entrance of water into the roots is
in obedience," he said, "to a law of nature; for wherever
very narrow tubes exist which touch the water, it enters
into them, and even rises, contrary to its natural inclination."</p>


<p class="p1a">Many botanists adopted the opinion of Mariotte. But if
it were well founded, all <em>capillary</em> bodies, even inorganic
ones, ought to present a circulatory movement analogous
to that of the sap. Now, this is not the case. A body
must be animated, must be living, for attraction to take
place in the narrow tubes, and to produce a movement
comparable to that of the nutritive liquid.</p>


<p class="p1a">Malpighi attributed the rise of the sap to the alternating
rarefaction and condensation of this liquid by heat; Perrault,
to a kind of fermentation; De Saussure, to a peculiar irritability
of the vessels. Of these three hypotheses, the first is
purely physical; the second, chemical; the third, vital. So,
as we see, there is something for everybody&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chacun à son
gout!</i></p>


<p class="p1a">The same question has, in our own day, been taken up
from a new point of view, on the occasion of Dutrochet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
discovery of the endosmose. This philosopher was one of
the first to perceive that two liquids, separated from one
another by a membrane, quickly effect or induce a current
which always carries the thinner liquid towards the denser,
and ends by mingling the two completely. "It is endosmose,"
he said, "which produces at one and the same time
the progression of the sap by <em>impulsion</em>, and its progression
by <em>affluxion</em>. The sap would receive its impulse in the
spongioles of the roots; thence would be carried towards the
upper parts by the turgescence of the organs&mdash;by the affluxion,
which would thus act as a forcible mode of suction."</p>

<p>The basis of this theory is, that the sap contained in the
upper parts will be more concentrated or denser than that
in the lower portions of the same plant. But this is a mere
supposition. And even this supposition has been swept
away by the recent experiments of Hartig and others, which
show that the difference in density between the two saps
is not only almost null, but in many ligneous plants the
lower sap is, on the contrary, denser than the upper.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>


<p class="p1a">Finally, and more recently, M. Joseph Boehm has put
forth a theory which offers some points of analogy with
that of Grew. According to Boehm, the rise of the sap
is the effect of a suction, the cause of which must be sought
both in the atmospheric pressure and in the transpiration
which takes place through the organs, and notably through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the leaves of the plant. The part which he attributes to
the cellules, of which the organs are composed, he thus
describes:&mdash;"When the superficial cellules of the plant
lose water by transpiration," he says, "of two things, one
will happen: either these cellules will contract and shrivel,
or they carry up, by a kind of aspiration, to the neighbouring
cellules, situated in deeper layers, a quantity of water
equivalent to what they had lost. In the normal condition,
the latter is always the result; each cellule takes from its
neighbour what itself has lost, and this action, becoming
more and more general, is continued from the leaves to
the extremities of the roots. The cellules of the spongioles
replace the water which they have yielded, from the humid
medium surrounding them."</p>

<p>In support of this theory,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> M. Boehm has made several
experiments, which, we fear, will not carry conviction to
every mind.</p>


<p class="p1a">In the different theories which we have been attempting
to explain, their authors, as it seems to us, have neglected
an essential element&mdash;the <em>life</em> of the plant. Then, the
experiments undertaken by way of proof, have been made
upon cut stems or branches, which, consequently, did not
enjoy their integral vitality. In fact, the results indicated
could just as well have been obtained with inert as with
living matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking into account all these considerations, we are doubtful
whether any value can be placed on the theories just
enunciated. Undoubtedly, physical causes, such as capillarity,
heat, evaporation, atmospheric pressure, electricity,
have a certain marked and constant action. But this
action is here complex; it is found combined with a new
force, whose effects constitute precisely the profound difference
which exists between the massive mineral framework
of the globe and the transitory beings peopling its surface.
It matters little whether we call it <em>vital force</em>, or otherwise;
sufficient that it <em>exists</em>. We must, therefore, allow for its
influence when endeavouring to explain the varied movements

<p>Among all the treasures of the floral world, that which
should excite in each of us the tenderest emotion, and most
readily stir up in our minds thoughts too deep for tears, is
the Daisy,&mdash;that favourite of our innocent and happy childhood.</p>

<p>Ah! would we were now as content with simple joys as
in the days when that wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower
was to us a beauty, a prize, and a charm!</p>

<p>Yes! let no poet be taken to your heart of hearts who

<p>&mdash;Burns's "bonnie gem,"&mdash;the flower of the meadow and
the lea, of the woodland and the vale.</p>

<p>A modest, unassuming flower, destined to be trodden
under the feet of the thoughtless, it withstands the rigorous
breath of winter, is beautiful throughout the circle of the year&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bellis
perennis</i>, as the Swedish botanist not infelicitously
called it. Its vegetation is arrested only during the harshest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
frosts; but it resumes its living growth as soon as it becomes
sensible of the first rays of the spring-time sun.</p>

<p>It is at the moment of nature's awakening, about "the
solemn Easter-tide," that this "sweet nursling of the vernal
year" displays all the simple coquettishness of its chaplet of
flowers,&mdash;that chaplet which has also procured for it the name
of the tiny "Marguerite,"&mdash;that is, "little pearl,"&mdash;a name
which the French have adopted from the Latin&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Margarita</i>.</p>

<p>Here let us pause, and propound a question.</p>

<p>How would you propose to test the real character, the
genuine nature, of friend or acquaintance?</p>

<p>Your answers, dear readers (believe me, I hear them
clearly!), are very various. Some of you say, that the best
means of sounding the depths of the human heart is by
bringing before it a misery which needs to be relieved.
Others recommend the bestowal of a benefit. But such
processes of analysis appear to me far from being infallible;
too wide a margin is left for the operation of sentiments of
pride or vanity. Why not conduct the man whose real
character you wish to discover into a meadow enamelled
with sparkling daisies? Thus you would impose upon nature
the task of interrogating him. If he manifest feelings of
indifference, you will do well to regard him with suspicion:
take care how you admit him into your intimacy; for his
heart must be cold, and his mind troubled&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The man that takes not daisies to his soul</div>
  <div class="i0">Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But to return to our daisy. Observe how, by its organs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
it yields itself&mdash;in anticipation, as it were&mdash;to its fate. And,
first, its long and fibrous roots anchor it so solidly in the soil
that the cattle which browse it cannot tear it up. Next, its
stem is so short that it seems to be blended with the roots;
one might almost doubt whether any existed. But, if you
look at it more closely, you may readily assure yourself that
the stem is the point whence issue the recumbent branches
which bear the leaves. Why does not the daisy boast of
stems erect and free? Would they not be incessantly bent
or broken by the merry troops of children who love to play
and dance upon Nature's carpet, the soft green sward?</p>


<p class="p1a">The leaves of our daisy, then, seem to issue directly from
the roots, without the intermediary of an <em>apparent</em> stem, which
must not be confounded&mdash;recollect this, dear reader!&mdash;with
the stalk or peduncle that bears the crown of petals. These
leaves in form resemble tiny crenelated spatules, with the
handles flattened, and the edges trimmed with little hairs
or fibres. The peduncle, too, seems to start immediately from
the roots. The principal part of the peduncle is surmounted,
as already hinted, by the flower, to which we next direct our
inquisitive and searching gaze.</p>

<p>What shall we call it? To what shall we liken it? To
a gilded button framed in a pearl. This button, this "yellow
eye," as Tabernæmontanus, a botanist of the sixteenth century,
named it,&mdash;the "eye of day" of our old poets,&mdash;a
drop of gold in a rim of silver,&mdash;is not like any other flower;
is quite a world or system of Lilliputian blossoms, each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which is represented by a miniature tube, yellow at the summit,
and of a greenish white at the base,&mdash;the said tube being
the union, or combination, of the tops or summits forming the
central gem, the gilded button, the drop of gold. You may
readily note this arrangement in the larger variety of daisy,
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chrysanthemum leucanthum</i> of Linnæus,&mdash;two Latinised
Greek words which signify, literally, "golden-blossomed
white flower."</p>

<p>If you doubt whether each of these tiny tubes be a flower,
you have only to analyse them with the assistance of your
ever-useful lens. The analysis of one will suffice; for all the
others resemble it. Now, with your penknife, split the tube
throughout its entire length: you will thus lay bare all the
parts which enter into the composition of a veritable flower,
commencing with the most conspicuous. Through the magnifying
glass you can see five stamens,&mdash;free as regards their
short filaments, but united by their elongated anthers; a
characteristic which gives name to the great family of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Synantheraceæ</i>, of which family our daisy is an honoured
member;&mdash;a bifid (<i>i.e.</i>, cloven in two) style traversing the
middle of the anthers, which form for it a kind of sheath
(see Fig. 31, <i>a</i>);&mdash;a monopetalous, tubular, and obscurely
bilabiated (two-lipped) corolla, inserted at the summit of an
unilocular (one-lobed) ovary, which is attached to the calyx
(see Fig. 31, <i>b</i>). In these tiny flowers, then, which we call
in Latin <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">flosculi</i>, in French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurons</i>, in English <em>florets</em>,
nothing is deficient. As they are shaped like tubes, we call
them, by way of distinction, <em>tubulifloral</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>But what are these white rays, lightly shaded with pink,
which enclose or encircle the florets? (See Fig. 32, <i>a</i>.)
Examine them at their points of insertion. You will perceive
there some traces of reproductive organs, among which the
style is most prominent. As for the corolla, it is represented
only by its brown lip, which is immeasurably developed. It
is this exaggerated development which constitutes the <em>white
rays</em>, or petals, that prove so attractive to the eye. (See Fig.
32, <i>b</i>.) Do not forget to observe, by the way, that they are
rose-tinted only on the side which directly undergoes the action
of the light. To distinguish them from the tubular florets,&mdash;the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tubulifloræ</i>,&mdash;these "white rays" have been called <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ligulate
florets</i>, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ligulifloræ</i>.</p>

<p>The complete flowers (or the florets) and the rays (or partially
abortive flowers) form, in their aggregate, what our botanists
have agreed to call an <em>inflorescence of the capitula</em>. Disposed
quincuncially on an ovoid receptacle, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">phoranth</i>, both are grouped
(Fig. 32, <i>c</i>) in alternating rows.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_161.jpg" width="400" height="274" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span><span style="margin-left: 7em;">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span></span></p></div>
</div>

<p>To explain thoroughly this species of inflorescence, we will
venture upon an hypothesis. Let us suppose that we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
elongate the said ovoid receptacle as if it were a ball of wax,&mdash;it
would be changed into a sheath-like inflorescence; all our
smaller florets, whose union composes what is improperly
called the <em>flower</em> of the daisy, would be ranged around an
elongated, instead of being placed upon a flattened axis.
This axis characterises all the Synantheraceæ of the family
of the Compositæ (a sub-order); sometimes naked, sometimes
garnished with varied hairs, either shrunken or persistent, it
has furnished several characters useful in the classification of
genera and species. But possessed with a mania for complicating
everything, botanists designate it indifferently <em>receptacle</em>,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">phoranthe</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">clinanthe</i>, etc. Why not employ one and
the same word to distinguish one and the same thing? Why
not have preserved the name <em>axis</em>, and have attached to it
such qualifying terms as might be necessary to indicate simple
differences of forms?</p>


<p class="p1a">The ancients looked upon nature,&mdash;I cannot sufficiently
insist upon this theme,&mdash;with quite other eyes than we do.
The study and description of characters, so indispensable to
our classifications and nomenclatures, appeared to them a
useless labour; they had not even an idea of its value. But
it was of signal importance to them to investigate the virtues
and properties of plants, so far as they might be rendered available
for the preservation of health and the cure of disease.</p>

<p>Our daisy is common in Greece. Theophrastus, therefore,
ought to have known it, though he does not refer to it. It is
common also in the plains of Italy. Pliny was the first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
describe it, under the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bellis</i>; he attributes to it the
properties of the St John's wort.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> And it is noteworthy that
the daisy belongs to the same family as the latter; a circumstance
certainly not known in the days of Pliny.</p>

<p>The botanists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
are by no means niggards in the eulogiums which they lavish
on the medicinal properties of our graceful Synantheracea.
Bock (better known, perhaps, under the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tragus</i>, a
Goat), who mistook the yellow anthers for the seeds, recommended
the leaves of the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gänzeblume</i> (goose-flower, as he
called it) as a laxative. Tabernæmontanus prescribed them
as a remedy for cramps in the stomach and the spitting of
blood.</p>

<p>Ray, who expresses his astonishment that the Greeks had
not spoken of it, looked upon the daisy as an excellent
vulnerary. "Externally," says he, "we employ it with success
in the form either of a poultice or a fomentation; for
internal treatment, we mix its juice with vulnerary potions."&mdash;These
properties procured it the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consolida minor</i>,
which would make it the pendant of the larger Consolida,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Symphytum officinale</i>, a species of the Boraginaceæ, very common
in damp and shady localities.</p>

<p>Ruel recommended cataplasms of daisies and cowslips for
gout and scrofulous tumours. Chomel affirmed that he
knew by experience that the flowers of the daisy and the
<em>herb robert</em><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Geranium Robertianum</i>), if dried in a hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
dish, and applied to the head, considerably relieved headache.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Wepfer set great value on a mixture of daisy, cress, and
rummularia in the treatment of pneumonia; and Michaelis
assures us that he had cured dropsies by the use of the flowers
of the daisy cooked as a broth.</p>

<p>Tournefort, who was very partial to this kind of observation,&mdash;now
repudiated by our botanists,&mdash;says, that the
daisy, taken as a warm drink or a decoction, quickens the
blood when congealed by a very severe attack of cold, as
happens in pneumonia; it removes obstructions, facilitates
the circulation, and gives the fibres an opportunity of recovering
their elasticity.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Garidel sums up in the following words the result of his
personal observations:&mdash;"I have frequently remarked that the
juice of the daisy acts as a laxative, and even as a purgative;
the decoction does not have that effect so often as Schroeder
observes, who says that mothers frequently give the leaves
as a gentle aperient to their children.... Care should be
taken not to administer this remedy indifferently to all
pleuretics, nor at any season; for if we give it when the
expectoration is easy, we run the risk, by the employment of
a laxative at a wrong time, of spoiling everything, and checking
the expectoration. This I have seen occur in several cases,
where the remedy had been administered by a hermit."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Can it be true that the commonest plants are the most
useful? Nature is quite capable of affording us these surprises;
nature, who, by her shifting and proteiform movements,
never ceases to laugh at human theories. But men,
as was said long ago, have eyes, though not to see; and
everybody also knows, from his own experience, that he has
ears, not to understand!</p>

<p>However this may be, the daisy, which, as we have seen,
was formerly so extolled for its officinal properties, is now-a-days
completely ignored by physicians. What, then, are we
to conclude? That all the remedies in vogue&mdash;melancholy
to confess!&mdash;are an affair of fashion. When men shall have
resumed perukes, and women abandoned chignons for furbelows,
we shall remember, perhaps, the virtues of the lowly,
tender daisy.</p>

<p>We cannot take leave of our favourite wild-flower without
repeating Wordsworth's beautiful stanzas. He takes as his
motto a fine passage from Wither, quaint old George
Wither:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is probable that, for the majority of floral amateurs, the
name of the tulip is inseparable from a plant which, with the
hyacinth and the lily, becomes, in the merry spring-time, the
ornament of our gardens. Yet, towards the end of March,
the observer will occasionally discover, in the woods and
groves, the <em>wild tulip</em>,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tulipa sylvestris</i> of Linnæus, which
may, perhaps, be very properly taken for the type of a small
tribe of the Liliaceæ. It is easily recognised by its flower,
which resembles a large yellow campanula, slightly green on
the exterior. Like all plants of the same family, it has but
a single floral envelope or perianth, which may be either
a corolla or a calyx as you will. The initiated protest and
asseverate that it is a calyx; but the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">profanum vulgus</i>, who
compose the majority, will have it to be a corolla, on account
of its colouring. To cut the knot, and please all parties, our
beautiful floral envelope has been denominated a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">petaloid
perianth</i>.</p>

<p>The divisions of this perianth, six in number, may, in truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
be considered as <em>petals</em>; they are detached down to the base,
and full in proportion as the pistil is developed. The latter
is composed of three stigmata, attached, without the intermediary
of a stylus (sessile stigmata), to a free ovary (that is,
an ovary not joined to the perianth), which, as it develops,
forms a capsule with three angular projections marking so
many lobes; each of these lobes includes a great number
of compressed seeds. As in all the Liliaceæ, and in many
other vegetable families, the stamens, six in number, are
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">hypogynous</i>,&mdash;that is to say, inserted at the base of the
division of the perianth. The stem, nearly two feet in
height, bears a single flower only: the leaves are lanceolate,
like all of the family, and the root is formed of a bulb,
with thin and brownish-coloured external <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tunicæ</i>.</p>

<p>Is the wild tulip an original species, or only a degenerate
variety of the cultivated tulip (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tulipa Gesneriana</i>)? The
question is one not very easily solved.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that the cultivated tulip,&mdash;which
everybody knows,&mdash;was introduced into Europe from the
East, towards the middle of the sixteenth century. It is,
at all events, certain that none of our older botanists speak
of our wild tulip. Dodonnée himself refers to the Eastern
tulip only, of which he was the first to give, in his "Historia
Stirpium," a tolerable delineation.</p>

<p>A circumstance which would favour the belief that the
tulip was imported from the East is the Oriental derivation
of its name: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tulipa</i>, in Italian <em>tulipano</em>, comes to us, it is
said, from the Turkish <i xml:lang="tr" lang="tr">tuliband</i>, or the Persian <em>dulbend</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
whence is obtained, by corruption, <em>turban</em>, the characteristic
head-gear of the Orientals. Thus, at bottom, <em>tulip</em> and
<em>turban</em> are the same word, only altered in form.</p>


<p class="p1a">Who does not know with what a glory of colours the
skill of our horticulturists has succeeded in clothing the
tulip?</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the cultivated species bears the distinctive
addition of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gesneriana</i>,&mdash;and of this species all existing tulips
are but varieties,&mdash;we might reasonably suppose that Gesner,
the celebrated Swiss naturalist (who died at Zurich, aged sixty-nine,
in 1565), was the first to speak of it. But he makes no
allusion to it in his "Historia Plantarum" (printed at Bâle in
1541); he only refers to it in his "Additions" to the works
of Valerius Cordus, published in 1561.</p>

<p>We subjoin a literal translation of the words of Conrad
Gesner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the year 1559, at the beginning of April, I saw at
Augsburg, in the garden of F. H. Herwart, magistrate of
that town, a plant whose seed had been brought from Constantinople,
or, according to some, from Cappadocia. It was
called <em>tulip</em>."</p>

<p>About the same epoch, this plant was cultivated at Vienna,
in the gardens of some wealthy amateurs; whence several
tulip-bulbs were afterwards sent into England.</p>

<p>This ornamental plant, whose splendour is of such brief
duration, became, towards the middle of the sixteenth century,
the object of a commercial speculation, which marks an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
epoch in horticultural annals. The towns of Amsterdam,
Haarlem, Utrecht, Alkmar, Leyden, and Rotterdam, were the
head-quarters of the new trade.</p>

<p>The years 1634 to 1637 marked its apogee, its culmination;
it was the reign of the <em>tulipomania</em>,&mdash;a malady which,
notwithstanding its severity, does not figure among our
pathological nomenclatures. Bulbs of the variety called
<em>Viceroy</em> were sold for 3000 florins (£235) each; and
amateurs paid even as high as 5000 florins (£430) for the
<em>Semper Augustus</em> variety! Those who had not the needful
amount of ready money disposed of their goods, their
cattle, and their furniture. And not only the horticulturists,
but the seamen, and artisans, and servants, plunged headlong,
into this frantic gambling. Tulip bulbs were then as
eagerly sought after as shares in the company of the Mississippi
in the days of Law,&mdash;or in the South Sea Stocks, also
set afloat by that ingenious financier.</p>

<p>But it was not so much a love of flowers as a lust of
speculation which lay at the bottom of this famous mania.
For example, a gentleman engaged a merchant to deliver,
at the end of six months, a bulb worth 1000 florins. When
the time came, the price of the bulb had either gone up
or down, and the contractor paid only the difference; as
for delivering the wares, neither party cared about it. It
was, therefore, the exact equivalent of a speculation in the
funds or in railway shares. The transactions took place on
the public exchanges, as well as in coffee-houses, inns, and
on the promenades. They originated a fertile crop of abuses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and to put an end to them the intervention of the Government
was required.</p>

<p>However, we may cite several examples of distinguished
men who have cherished a partiality for the tulip, in the
better sense of the word. Among these was Justus Lipsius,
the great philologist. In his garden he cultivated with his
own hands, it is said, the rarest varieties, and his floricultural
tastes were shared by two of his intimate friends, Dodonée
(Diodati) and L'Écluse, the two most illustrious botanists of
their time.</p>

<p>But all these details, however curious and interesting, do
not teach us whether our wild tulip has sprung from the
cultivated germs. As it is impossible to solve this problem
experimentally, we are forced to be satisfied with a simple
conjecture.</p>

<p>And, for our own part, we are strongly of opinion that the
wild and cultivated tulips may, from their very origin, have
co-existed independently of one another. And now to put
forward a fact in support of this statement.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Heliotrope.</span></p>

<p>With the Heliotrope every lover of flowers is familiar; it
is not less prized for its delicate fragrance than the tulip for
its glowing colours. No doubt exists as to the country from
which we have imported the cultivated heliotrope, nor as to
the epoch when it was introduced: it came from Peru, whence
the name given to it by Linnæus, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Heliotropium Peruvianium</i>;
and was brought into Europe, in 1740, by Joseph de Jussieu.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Although not known in Europe above a hundred and thirty
years, it is now an "old, familiar face" in every garden.
Now, by the side of the cultivated species, a native of the
New World, we can place a wild variety, indigenous to the
Old World, common in our own country, and, indeed, in all
the countries of temperate Europe; whence it has received
the appellation of <i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Heliotropium Europæum</i>.</p>

<p>The European species, let me state, is in every respect
similar to the Peruvian species, except that its flowers are
inodorous and of a paler blue. Yet it was known before the
discovery of America,&mdash;before the discovery of those regions
from which we have obtained the cultivated heliotrope.
Thus, the two varieties have existed contemporaneously, and
have flourished independently of each other, from their very
origin. Why should not such be the case with the wild and
cultivated tulip?</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Anemones.</span></p>

<p>From our Spring posy the delicate Anemones must not be
omitted. More than twenty species are cultivated in Great
Britain, and I hardly know to which I would give the preference.
They are called by that most unmeaning term,
"florist's flowers," and from the attention bestowed upon
them, the cultivated varieties have been greatly improved.
But you and I, dear reader, will go forth into the "wild
woods," and enjoy the rich gifts of nature untampered by
horticultural science. It is towards the end of March that
the wood anemone (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anemone nemorosa</i>) begins to expand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
its graceful leaves and snow-white buds to the stray sunbeams
that force their way through the embowering branches of
stately elms and spreading beeches, and in April it has
attained its full glory, contributing largely to the beauty
and the show which then embellish the forest glade. Snow-white,
and faint rose-red, and soft delicate lilac,&mdash;these are
the prevailing hues of its tender petals.</p>

<p>It is said that the wood anemone never blossoms earlier
than March 16, and never later than April 2. It opens out
its loveliness to the sun about the same time as the swallow
returns from the genial South to our land of pleasant verdure.
Country children associate it with the appearance of the
cuckoo, and call it the "cuckoo flower," but the "wandering
voice" is later than the woodland blossom in its welcome
to the spring.</p>

<p>Why is it called <em>Anemone</em>? Of course, the English name
is derived from the Greek άνεμος, "wind;" but what connexion
is there between the wind and the flower? Credulous
old Pliny asserted that it never bloomed except when the
wind blew. Some of our botanical writers explain that it
shivers and bends before the winds of March and the breezes
of April. Others remind us that though generally found in
the shelter of the groves, it will thrive lustily in windy and
exposed localities. But I suspect the true reason of the
name is its peculiar sensitiveness to atmospheric changes.
As a foreteller of the storm it is not less trustworthy than a
barometer, never failing to fold up its exquisite petals when
the winds are gathering over the distant hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Our plant is considered injurious food for cattle; and it
was on account of its unwholesome properties, perhaps, that
the Egyptians regarded it as an emblem of sickness; or
the idea may have been suggested by its frail and feeble
appearance.</p>

<p>The yellow wood anemone is a rare and beautiful variety,
which I have sometimes met with among the chalky downs
of Kent. Its botanical designation is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anemone ranunculoides</i>.</p>

<p>A still richer species is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anemone pulsatilla</i>, or Pasque
Flower Anemone; a silky downy plant, easily recognised by its
blossom of glowing purple. The blue mountain anemone
(<em>Anemone Apennina</em>) is only to be found, as its name indicates,
on the bold rugged sides of lofty mountain-heights.</p>

<p>The Anemones belong to a very important order,&mdash;the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ranunculaceæ</i>, or Crowfoot family,&mdash;which is divided into
five sub-orders: 1. Clematidæ; 2. Anemoneæ; 3. Ranunculaceæ;
4. Helliboreæ; and 5. Act&oelig;æ, or P&oelig;niæ. Linnæus
distinguishes forty-one known genera, comprising a thousand
species. There are nine British genera of Anemoneæ.</p>

<p>In Drayton's "Poly-Olbion" occurs a rich descriptive
passage,&mdash;an exquisite "flower-piece,"&mdash;which, on account
of its beauty, deserves to be better known, and more frequently
quoted. The poet is enlarging upon the floral rites
which were celebrated at the espousals of the rivers Thame
and Isis, and sets before us a bright bevy of Nymphs and
Naiads; engaged in twining "dainty chaplets" to deck the
persons of the bride and bridegroom. The stalwart Thame,&mdash;so
it seems to them,&mdash;should not be "dressed with flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to gardens that belong," but with blossoms plucked from his
own meads and pastures. As most of those selected are fit
for a spring-time nosegay, we may well enrich our pages with
quaint old Drayton's enumeration of them:&mdash;</p>

<p>If our space permitted, we should like to gossip awhile about
each of the flowers commemorated by our old poet, for to
each attaches some legend, or romantic tradition, some rural
observance, or sweet poetical association. But we must continue
our researches, and they bring us now to the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arum</i>.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Arum.</span></p>

<p>To the French the Arum is commonly known as the Calf's
foot (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pied de veau</i>). It is a common enough plant, growing
on the borders of the wood, and delighting especially in the
shade of the hazel trees, but it bears not the slightest resemblance
to the hoof of any quadruped whatsoever, unless,
indeed, to a very fervid imagination there should be visible a
shadowy similitude in its leaf.</p>

<p>And it is, in truth, asserted&mdash;but, not having the eye of faith,
the editor cannot see any ground for the assertion&mdash;that its
sagillate or arrow-headed leaves, marked by a strongly-defined
midrib, bear a certain likeness to the "under bi-ungulated
face" of the foot of a young ruminant. Appearing in the early
days of spring, they contrast agreeably, by their shining verdure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
with the colour of the dead leaves heaped up at the base of
the hedgerows. Simultaneously with its leaves comes forth
a curious organ,&mdash;rare in vegetables of temperate regions,
common in the tropical palms, and characteristic of the family
of the Aroidaceæ, to which our Arum belongs. This organ,
rolled up in a coil or spiral, is named the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">spathe</i>. It protects
the flowers in their young state, and, as they are developed,
gradually falls off. Its colour is a greenish yellow; at the
summit it is sometimes streaked with purplish veins, and at
the base it swells out in a globose fashion.</p>

<p>A small thermometer, introduced into the interior of the
rolled-up spathe, indicates a rise of temperature equal to
one or two degrees above that of the external atmosphere.
Whence comes this difference? Because in the spathe is
frequently found imprisoned another organ, the seat of the
mystery of reproduction. This organ is a fleshy axis, on
which are arranged the flowers in two distinct rings; the
upper is occupied by the stamens, reduced to simple anthers
(sessile stamens); observe the filamentous appendages&mdash;they
are abortive ovaries. These same appendages also surmount
the lower ring, where several rows are set of sessile ovaries;
each ovary composed of a single lobe, containing a very small
number of ovules, the majority of which miscarry as the
ovaries become metamorphosed into bright red berries: these
are the fruits which appear in autumn; they form a spike or
ear of coral, each containing, ordinarily, a single seed. The
flowers, as a consequence of this separation of the two sexes,
are <em>mon&oelig;cious</em>; the succulent axis which bears them is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a spadix.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> On tearing open the spathe, our glance first rests
upon the apex of the spadix, which has a club-like form, and
is of a beautiful violet-red colour. The two rings of sexual
organs have much less attraction for the profane; the lower
ring, loaded with female flowers, is more prominent than the
upper ring, which bears the male flowers.</p>

<p>The root of our Arum also deserves a particular examination.
It is a white tubercular stock or stem, containing a
quantity of fecula, mixed, as in the West Indian manioc, with
an acrid poisonous principle which produces a burning painful
heat in the throat. This injurious principle is destroyed
by exposure to the fire, and by repeatedly boiling the plant
in water. After being thus heated, there remains only the
fecula, in the form of a white powder, which, in times of
scarcity, supplies a very nutritious food. "I made use of it,"
says Bosc, "during the storms of the Revolution, when I had
taken refuge in the solitudes of the forest of Montmorency.
This plant is so abundant in this forest, and in many other
localities, that, at the epoch I speak of, it would have ensured
the subsistence of several thousands of men, if they had known
its alimentary properties. I was seriously counting on the
resources which it would place at my disposal, when the
death of Robespierre relieved me from my difficulties."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Our <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">arum</i>, which we have taken as a type of the family of
the Aroidaceæ, is called <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">maculatum</i>, or "spotted," in allusion
to the white and violet spots with which its leaves are besprinkled.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_181.jpg" width="350" height="338" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>&mdash;The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arum arisarum</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another, and not less interesting species, is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arum arisarum</i>.
(See Fig. 34, <i>a</i>.) It loves to display its exquisite leafage on the
rocks bordering the "sea-marge," and is found in profusion along
almost the entire littoral of the Mediterranean. It is a precocious
flower&mdash;making its appearance about the end of December, and
flourishing until the beginning of Spring. The spathe, which in the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arum maculatum</i> has all the aspect of an etiolated leaf, assumes, in
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arum arisarum</i>, the tints of a corolla,&mdash;is of a beautiful
warm red violet, streaked with white. The fleshy axis, which ought
rather to be called gynandrous (both male and female) than a spadix,
is of a red colour; naked in its upper portion, which terminates with
a kind of apple. It would remind a drummer-boy of the formidable staff
carried by his drum-major (see Fig. 34, <i>b</i>.); the stamens, reduced to
the condition of bilobed anthers, are mounted around the central part;
and the ovaries, less numerous than the stamens,
occupy the base of the axis. Each monocular ovary is
crowned by a sessile stigma, and each lobe contains a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
number of erect ovules. In the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arum maculatum</i>, the number
of ovules does not exceed six. Some botanists have laid hold
of this characteristic as an excuse for withdrawing the Mediterranean
species from the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">arums</i>, and creating a new genus,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">arisarum</i>. The variety we have just described is, in that case,
denominated the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arisarum vulgare</i>.</p>


<p class="p1a">The ancients have mentioned numerous species of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">arum</i>.
But it is a very difficult task to bring their nomenclature into
any kind of agreement with the species described by modern
botanists. However, we may, I think, regard the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">arisarum</i>
of Pliny and Dioscorides as positively identical with our <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arum
arisarum</i>. But we are unable to admit that the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">aron</i>, the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">hepha</i>, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dracunculus</i>, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dracontium</i>, can be, as commentators
represent, one and the same plant; still less can we
admit that this plant is our <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arum maculatum</i>, which is very
much rarer in the south than in the north and centre of
Europe. In the solution of such problems as these, geographical
botany is an element which must not be neglected.
Unfortunately it has never been taken into account by the
commentators on the great classical authorities.</p>

<p>Let me advance a simple proposition. Since the potatoe
has become diseased, and the species tends to degenerate,
may we not find a substitute for it,&mdash;at least, a partial one,&mdash;among
our Aroids, and, notably, in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arum maculatum</i>?</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Ranunculaceæ.</span></p>

<p>Let us return for a while to the order of Ranunculaceæ, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
which the Anemones have already furnished us with a specimen.
Several very poisonous plants are members of this
order; and, in truth, very few can be pronounced wholly
innocent. I do not think there is much harm in the <em>Lesser
Celandine</em>, however&mdash;the glossy, starry flower, yellow as a buttercup,
with heart-shaped leaves, which Wordsworth has celebrated:&mdash;</p>

<p>There cannot be much harm in it, for in the north of Europe
the peasantry boil its leaves, and eat them as greens. It
thrives in all parts of England, in green woods and meadows,
and on wild furzy wastes and open commons; under leafy
hedges, and even in the gay pastures, among the primroses and
hepaticas. A number of small, grain-like tubers lie around
it, close to the surface of the earth; whence it was a common
saying in "the days of old" that this plant showered down
wheat in its vicinity.</p>


<p class="p1a">To the same order belongs the <em>Buttercup</em> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ranunculus bulbosus</i>),
whose bulbous root procured for it from our forefathers
the name of "St Anthony's turnip."</p>

<p>If the good saint ever partook of buttercup-corms, we do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
not envy him his sensations; when boiled, they disorder the
stomach, and if eaten raw, act as an emetic.</p>

<p>It was formerly thought, says a pleasing writer, that crowfoot
(the buttercup is a species of crowfoot), mingled with the
pasture, improved its nature, and that the butter yielded by
cows which fed upon this mixture was of a superior quality.
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Nous avons changé tout cela</i>; we are wiser now; and have discovered
that cows carefully avoid eating buttercups, and that
several kinds of crowfoot are even poisonous to cattle. On
some pasture-lands, in those countries where the produce of
the dairy receives particular attention, women and children
are employed to destroy the crowfoot, which they do either
by pulling up the root, or by plucking off the flower, and preventing
it from dispersing its seed. The root of the buttercup
is of a highly stimulating property if taken in an uncooked
state, and its juice will occasion sneezing; but boiling deprives
this, as well as many other vegetable productions, of its injurious
properties. A similar effect is produced by drying it
in the sun; wherefore the hay crop is not at all deteriorated
by its acrid nature.</p>

<p>A very beautiful ornament of still pools and gently-flowing
streams is the <em>Water-ranunculus</em> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ranunculus aqua atilis</i>), whose
leaves vary according to the depth, or calmness, or swiftness
of their watery habitat, and are thus adapted to permit the
passage of water without suffering any injury from its force.
The leaves on the surface have a round lobed shape; those
immersed hang down in thin small fibres, which offer but little
resistance to the current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ranunculaceæ</span> also include the <em>Black Hellebore</em>, or
Christmas rose (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Helleborus niger</i>), one of our most splendid
winter-garden decorations, whose juice the ancients considered
a wonderful remedy for mental disorders. In whiteness it
rivals the snow, which often accumulates around it, and the
snow-drop, which is frequently bound up in the same wreath.
It is called the <em>Black Hellebore</em>, to distinguish it from the
two wild species which grow in our woods, its root being
covered with a thick black skin.</p>

<p>The fragrant white <em>Clematis</em> must not be omitted; its starry
drops are "things of beauty," which every true poetic eye will
know how to appreciate. It is sometimes called "Traveller's
Joy," and sometimes "Virgin's Bower;" either name is richly
suggestive of pleasant fancies. Do you remember the beautiful
picture in Keats's "Endymion," of the shady sacred retreat
where Adonis lay and slumbered? The clematis was one of
the precious flowers that adorned it:&mdash;</p>

<p>Finally, our order comprises the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hepatica</i>, with its blue or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
pink blossoms and three-lobed leaves, which, from their
fancied resemblance to the form of the liver, procured the
plant its English name of liverwort; the <i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Flos Adonis</i>, or
pheasant's eye,&mdash;the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">goutte-de-sang</i> of the French,&mdash;so called
because the ancients fabled that it sprang from the blood
of Adonis, when wounded by the bear; the marsh marigold;
the gay and vivacious larkspur; the deadly wolfsbane,
or aconite, which secretes so potent a poison; and
the aromatic love-in-a-mist, or French flower.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>


<p class="p2"><em>B.</em>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Animals.</span></p>

<p>Under the soft moss, under the stones, in all localities where
mouldiness is easily developed, under the closed doors of
cellars, you must certainly have more than once observed
a tiny creature of the form of a horse-bean, of a gray leaden
colour, and supplied with a considerable number of feet. This
last characteristic will induce you immediately to abandon the
idea that you have before you an insect.</p>

<p>Catch hold of it, and count its feet.</p>

<p>Well said; but it runs much more quickly than I would have
suspected from its previously dilatory movements.</p>

<p>Because it knows that danger threatens it, instinct impels
it to escape at its utmost speed. Do not be afraid to handle
it; the poor creature can do you no harm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Unable to escape, it counterfeits death, and remains perfectly
immovable.</p>

<p>Now examine it. It has fourteen feet, symmetrically arranged
in couples; their size perceptibly increases from the first to the
last. When the animal is at rest, they are coiled inside, so as
to form an angle whose opening faces the medial line. But
here is something much more curious; its body, which does
not possess the vestige of a wing, is also without those segments
which would divide it visibly, as in the case of insects,
into head, thorax, and abdomen; but is composed of rings,
hard and scaly, like those of a shrimp.</p>

<p>Can it be a crustacean?</p>

<p>Yes; the animal you hold in your hand, and which everybody
knew by the name of wood-louse long before our
naturalists knew how to classify it, belongs to the great animal
division of the <em>Articulata</em>, which, instead of having their
skeleton <em>inside</em> the body, like the Vertebrates, have it externally.
The Crustacea form a class of this division, to which
also belong the Insects, the Arachnida, and the Myriapoda.</p>

<p>Let us continue to anatomise our crustacean.</p>

<p>In front of its first ring (a transversal segment) you see a
little black head, with two lateral bead-like eyes, and a couple
of antennæ. The latter are each composed of three joints,
which are extremely mobile; their base is covered by the
edges of the sloping head. The most conspicuous rings of
the body are seven in number; their lateral borders are
pointed in front, and rounded behind. But, if you look
closely, you will see some other rings, a little less projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
than the former; they circumscribe the abdominal region, the
belly, properly so called, in which the intestines are lodged. These
rings, or abdominal segments, are six in number; but they have not all
the same form. The one which occupies the tail is triangular, pointed,
and surrounded by four (caudal) appendages. The three next segments,
counting from the front to the rear, are prolonged laterally in a
very marked manner; the two anterior, on the contrary, have no such
distinction. As for the caudal appendages, the two outer ones are very
strong, conical, and composed of two articulations, while the inner,
situated above the former, are frail, cylindrical, and terminated by a
tuft of hairs, whence issues a viscous liquid. (See Fig. 35, <i>a</i>.)</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>
The Wood-Louse.</p></div>
</div>

<p>An enumeration of these characteristics is tedious, but
necessary for the determination of the genus and the species.
They belong to the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Oniscus asellus</i>, or common wood-louse.
But why, you ask, why such a strange conjunction of names,&mdash;one
Greek, ὀνίσκος, the other Latin, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">asellus</i>? Both carry the
same meaning: why not, then, have called our tiny crustacean an ass-ass
(if such a compound be possible)? Why, neither close at hand nor at a
distance, has it the slightest resemblance to an ass; and to say that
we have only borrowed these names from the ancients, is neither an
explanation nor a justification.</p>

<p>But we have not yet done with the wood-lice. Are these
interesting little creatures (they <em>are</em> interesting, are they not?)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
oviparous or viviparous? I defy you to show me anywhere a
single wood-louse's egg. Have the patience to observe our
crustaceans more nearly. Among the crowd, you will remark
some&mdash;they are the females&mdash;with a kind of membraneous
pouch underneath the body, stretching from the head to the
fifth pair of legs. The pellicle which forms this pouch is so
thin, and so transparent, that you can distinguish the eggs
within it. These eggs, instead of being expelled for incubation,
remain in the mother's pouch until they are hatched. At
that felicitous moment, the membranous bag splits cross-wise,
longitudinally and transversally, to permit the emergence of
the young wood-lice. The latter are extremely small, and in
form resemble nothing in the world so much as a little white
line (Fig. 35, <i>b</i>). They differ from their parents only in having
one pair of feet, and one ring less than they have. They
undergo no metamorphoses. After their birth, the little ones,
which have proportionally very large antennæ, do not immediately
separate from their mother. By a wonderful act of forethought
on the part of Nature,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> they keep themselves concealed
in the middle of the respiratory <em>laminæ</em>, which garnish
the under part of the tail.</p>

<p>The specific characters of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Oniscus asellus</i> are tolerably
well defined. By its rings of dark gray, a little lighter at the
edges, which form for it an articulated, glossy carapace, marked
with white spots, longitudinally arranged; by the uniform pale
gray colour of its belly and its legs, covered with scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
hairs; and, particularly, by its habits, our wood-louse, which
the Germans call cellar-louse (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kellerlaus</i>), is distinguished from
its kindred species, of which naturalists have made distinct
genera. Thus, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">asellus</i> found generally under stones, which
counterfeits death by rolling itself up in a ball like a hedgehog,
and will rather suffer itself to be crushed than unfold, is the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Oniscus armadillo</i>, which some naturalists transform into the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Armadillo vulgaris</i>. (See Fig. 36.) This species prefers the
solitude of the field to inhabited places. Its body is considerably
expanded, and its rings do not terminate in a point
on their lateral and posterior edges.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Oniscus
armadillo.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Another species, equally common underneath stones, has
its head and tail covered over with granulations; its
antennæ are composed of seven joints, of which the
fourth and fifth are perceptibly situated lengthwise.
This is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Oniscus granulatus</i> of some entomologists;
others have designated it the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Porcellio scaber</i>. Why not simplify
the study of species?</p>

<p>The wood-lice seem to live upon decomposed vegetable
matter. But in default of other food, they devour their own
kind; in this respect resembling beings who are supposed to
rank much higher in the animal hierarchy.</p>

<p>In the pharmacop&oelig;ia of the ancients our wood-lice found a
place. Reduced into powder, and mixed with various substances,
they were prescribed as diuretic and aperient; but
they were long ago abandoned in medicine.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Dragon-Flies</span> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellulæ</i>).</p>

<p>In walking along the banks of a river, you must frequently
have seen hovering around you a cloud of insects, whom you
would readily take to be butterflies, were not you arrested in
your conjecture by the largeness of their head, the length of
their body, the form of their vivid, diaphanous, gauze-like
wings, and, generally,&mdash;which will most astonish you,&mdash;by their
carnivorous instincts. You have about you and before, then,
not butterflies, but Dragon-flies&mdash;the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellulæ</i> of naturalists.
They are the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demoiselles</i>, or "ladies," of the French; so called,
perhaps, in allusion to their airy and graceful flight.</p>

<p>Among these Libellulæ, one is called <em>Eleanora</em>. If she does
not shine so brightly as the others&mdash;if her colours are less
brilliant&mdash;she has, at least, the advantage of being so common
that you can easily obtain a specimen.</p>

<p>But, first, let us pause to think of the strange dissimilarity
in the names bestowed on the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellulæ</i> by the English and
French respectively. They are the <em>Dragon-flies</em> of the
former,&mdash;fierce, rapacious, formidable; the <em>Ladies</em> of
the latter,&mdash;elegant, light, and radiant. Here we have a glimpse
of national character. With the Frenchman, "appearance" counts for so
much; with the Englishman, everything depends upon the "reality." Yet
our English poets can appreciate their gay exterior. Moore speaks of
them as&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Beautiful as they are, they must be ranked among Nature's fiercest
and most insatiable destroyers. They are the terror of the insect
world. On this point we shall hereafter enlarge, but before I forget
it, I would fain relate an anecdote, in illustration of their voracity,
which I have read somewhere or other. A naturalist recounts with what
interest he has often watched the proceedings of the dragon-fly. He
has seen it, in a locality where white butterflies were numerous,
dart down as a hawk upon a quarry, seize with its legs a firm hold
of a butterfly, and carry it to a branch of an adjoining tree. In a
moment one of the white wings would drop from the boughs, and then
another would come wavering downwards, and so on, until all four had
fallen; and the dragon-fly, after a short pause, would again dart forth
in pursuit of a fresh victim. He never launched himself on his prey
when on a perfect horizontal line with it; but took care to be either
somewhat higher, or somewhat lower, so that he could seize it with his
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>But now let us consider by what characteristics the reader
is to recognise his Libellulæ.</p>

<p>The eyes are very large, the size of the insect considered;
of a brown colour, and nearly joined together at the top of
the head; in front of this point of junction a tiny vesicle is
visible, carrying three <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ocelli</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, little, simple, glossy eyes),
two on each side, and the third on the anterior margin:
the thorax is large, hairy, and composed of two yellow plates;
the abdomen laterally depressed, in such a manner as to give
great prominence to the medial line. This last and well-marked
feature it is which has procured for the Eleanora the
scientific name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellula depressa</i>,&mdash;a name proposed by Linnæus,
and unanimously adopted; such unanimity being a rare
occurrence among naturalists, though, to parody a phrase of
Sheridan's, when naturalists <em>do</em> agree, it is something wonderful!</p>

<p>In the male Libellulæ, the upper surface of the abdomen is
bluish in hue, and covered as it were with an ashy dust,
while in the female it is olive; in both sexes the first and
last abdominal segment are of a deeper shade than the other
segments. The feet are black, and bristle all over with stiff
hairs; the thighs are of a brownish red. The two pairs of
wings, each strongly reticulated, present, towards the extremity
of the upper border, a black rectangular spot; their base,
moreover, is edged with brown spots; the spots of the lower
pair are triangular and larger than those of the upper pair,
which are nearly linear. They form, to a certain extent, the
reservoir of the liquid which nourishes and maintains the
circulation of the network of the wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>The Libellula, which Geoffroy calls (in his "Histoire des
Insectes") the <em>Philinta</em>, is simply the male of the species we
have just been describing. You may see them</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Where water-lilies mount their snowy buds,"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>pursuing one another with an abrupt, jerking&mdash;I had almost
said <em>staccato</em>&mdash;flight.</p>


<p class="p1a">A species less common than the preceding, but closely
resembling it, is the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Françoise</i> of Geoffroy, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellula quadrimaculata</i>
of Linnæus. It owes its descriptive or specific
designation to the colours which diversify its wings. On the
outer edge of each, two brown marginal spots are conspicuous:
the first at the place where in the Eleanora (and
other species) the black spot is found, and the second nearly
in the centre of the external border, which, at this point, is
considerably compressed; moreover, the lower wings are
marked, beneath their yellow base, with a kind of triangular
spot of blackish brown, finely reticulated with yellow. Externally,
there is no difference of appearance between male
and female, except that the abdomen of the latter is somewhat
the larger.</p>


<p class="p1a">Now we come to the <em>Sylvia</em>, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellula cancellata</i> of
Linnæus. Its eyes and thorax wear a greenish hue; the
diaphanous wings are spotted with brown near the outer
margin; the abdomen is of a bluish-gray; the extremity of
the sixth segment, and the following segments, are wholly
black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>Julia</em>, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellula grandis</i> (Linn.), has been separated
from the Libellulæ by the great entomologists, such as
Fabricius and Latreille, and included in the genus <em>Aeshna</em>
(Ph&oelig;bus, what a name!), preserving the descriptive adjective
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">grandis</i>. What are the reasons put forward to justify this
separation? Principally, the form of the abdomen, and the
position of those little smooth and simple eyes, like tiny pearls
or <em>pearlets</em>, which we call <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ocelli</i>. In the Libellulæ, properly so
called, the ocelli, three in number, are situated on either side
and on the exterior margin of a kind of semi-triangular vesicle,
and the abdomen is slightly depressed, and not unlike a club;
while in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aeshnæ</i>
elongated, and almost cylindrical.</p>


<p class="p1a">The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aeshna grandis</i> (or the "Julia") is one of the largest
of the British species. Its head is large, and its eyes are of
a brown colour shading into blue; the yellow thorax has two
bright yellow bands or stripes obliquely painted on each side.
The abdomen is of a reddish or even rusty brown; generally
spotted with white and yellow at the top and bottom of
each wing. This species haunts the vicinity of streams and
"silent pools."</p>


<p class="p1a">We come, in due order, to the <em>Aeshna forcipata</em>, or "Carolina,"
with its dirty yellow head, and its greenish-yellow thorax,
the latter marked on each side with three oblique lines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
black: the abdomen is black, and composed of segments
laterally spotted with yellow.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span>&mdash;Male and Female of
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agarion virgo</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="p1a">The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellula</i>, which the illustrious Geoffroy
designates "Louisa," is, according to modern entomologists, neither
a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellula</i> nor a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aeshna</i>, but a species of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agarion</i>,&mdash;the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agarion virgo</i> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellula virgo</i>, Linn.) The Agarions are
distinguishable from the Libellula and the Aeshna by their remarkably
thin, filiform, and exceedingly elongated abdomen, and by the three
ocelli arranged triangle-wise on the top of the head.</p>

<p>The "Louisa" (<i>AgarionAgarion virgo</i>) is by no means uncommon in England,
and may be found along the upper course of the Thames, the Avon, and
other rivers. It is easily recognised by its frail slender body,
shining with metallic blue reflexes. There are numerous varieties,
distinguished by their varieties of "light and shade." The spotless
green-winged species is the "Ulrica" of Geoffroy. The two sexes are not
alike. In the centre of their delicately-reticulated wings the males
have a large bluish-brown spot, which is wanting in the females.</p>

<p>The genera <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellula</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aeshna</i>, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agarion</i> compose the small
family of the <em>Libellulites</em>&mdash;a family plainly and conspicuously
characterised by the size of their head, and by the two pairs
of diaphanous wings of almost equal dimensions (the posterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
pair is a <em>little</em> shorter than the anterior), which, while the
animal is at rest, are kept horizontally extended.</p>

<p>devote yourself to its patient examination.</p>

<p>It is only such an examination that can reveal to us some
equally important, but less obvious features of the insect.
But to catch a Dragon-fly is not always an easy task; the
Libellulæ are very timorous, or else they are suspicious of the
prowling naturalist who seeks what he can entrap. Their flight
is livelier and swifter than even that of the butterfly: when disturbed
in their repose, they fly away abruptly, their wings
rustling or crackling like a sheet of parchment; if obstinately
pursued, they grow irritated, and in their quick jerking movements
exhibit all the rage of the Carnivora.</p>

<p>But can our Libellulæ be carnivorous? Most undoubtedly.
To convince yourself of it, you have but to glance at their
mouth, which is wholly unlike a butterfly's. What an arsenal
of weapons adapted for seizing and crushing a victim! How
strong are those saw-toothed scaly mandibles! How strong
their auxiliaries, the jaws, which terminate in that dentated
spring projection, furnished internally with ciliæ! Surely,
such instruments testify to their ferocious instincts, and should
induce our French neighbours to deny them the graceful name
of "les demoiselles." What a libel on tender woman,&mdash;on
man's "ministering angel!" Do but observe them. They
do not rest upon the blossom to extract its nectared sweets;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
in truth, they could not do so, for they are not furnished with
a proboscis. Warlike as the Amazons,&mdash;the only portion of
the female sex they can justly be said to resemble,&mdash;they
hover in the air to pounce, like vultures, upon whatever
insects may come within their reach; they quickly transfix,
and as quickly devour them. If they love to fly about the
pools, the marshes, and the streams, it is because they are
sure of prey in these localities. And, in fact, they there
encounter and devour an innumerable quantity of flies, moths,
gnats, and the like.</p>


<p class="p1a">But there is another reason why the Dragon-flies, obeying
the secret impulse of nature, resort to the haunts we have
been describing. They were their cradles or nurseries, and
they become, in due time, the scenes of their espousals.</p>


<p class="p1a">Before speaking of the singular metamorphosis they afterwards
accomplish, we must touch lightly on the subject of the
mode of reproduction of our brilliant <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demoiselles</i>.</p>

<p>It is laid down as a law that, in the insect world, the males
are invariably smaller or weaker than the females. Yet this
law does not hold good with reference to the Libellulæ, whose
males are, on the contrary, larger and stronger than their
females. Man may lay down laws, and extort obedience to
them, within his own domain; but nature laughs at human
rules, and gives up her secrets only to the free thought, unshackled
by the fetters of authority.</p>

<p>But why is the male Dragon-fly stronger than the female?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Because the former must make the first advances, and carry
off his aërial companion to celebrate their bridal. For this
purpose, he holds her tightly by the neck, and continues to
fly in this way for some few minutes. At length, he perches
himself on the branch of a willow, or the leaf of an aquatic
plant, along with his companion.</p>

<p>The eggs laid by the female are oblong in shape, and sometimes
united together in clusters: the female deposits them
in the water, or on some water-floated leaf plant, shortly after
their fecundation.</p>

<p>If in your walks abroad you should meet with a pool of
turbid water, do not object to linger for a moment on its
brink. Nature, as a reward for your trouble, will gratify you
with an extraordinary surprise. Stir up the mud with a stick,
or, better still, with your hand; and then, as the children say,
you shall see&mdash;what you shall see!</p>

<p>Oh, what an ugly creature is struggling in this handful of
slime! It looks like a large spider!</p>

<p>Nay, examine it more attentively; it can do you no harm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, it is a singular animal; greenish in colour, bristling with
hairs, and covered with mud. It is not a spider, for it has only six
legs and these are exactly like the legs of insects. I can distinctly
make out three joints (articulations) to each tarsus, which terminates
in a simple hook. The belly is formed of regular segments; is rounded
above, and flat underneath. What do I see? On the top, and nearly in
the middle, each ring is armed with a spine, so that the row of spiny
projections remind one of the back of a crocodile. Pray tell me, what
is this curious creature?</p>

<p>Before I tell you, I would have you more thoroughly acquainted with
it. Continue your examination.</p>

<p>The face has a strange expression; it looks&mdash;the insect, I
mean&mdash;like a masked knight. Its mask, formed of a scaly substance
and thoroughly compact, is composed of two pieces, which are separated
from one another by a transversal suture: the upper, which is broader
than it is high, we may call the vizor; it consists of two lobes,
soldered together longitudinally; the lower, which is higher than it is
broad, will be the chin-piece; it is triangular in shape, and its base
rests against the vizor, while the summit is jointed or articulated
with a support, which acts as a hinge when the mask is raised or
lowered.</p>

<p>These movements, let me tell you, are voluntary; the
animal raises its mask to arrest on their way the Infusoria and
other animalcules on which it feeds. For crushing them, it
is provided with strong mandibles, which you can detect by
lowering the mask with a pin, or the point of a penknife. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
eyes, which resemble little mammillary protuberances, are situated
above and outside of the vizor. On the animal's back, where the belly
joins the thorax, do you observe those four little sheath-like or
scabbard-like tongues? The extremity of the body, the tail, is marked
by three conspicuous triangular points, lying close to the opening,
through which the water enters and issues, as if it were alternately
sucked in and poured out by a piston. This, you must understand, is the
respiratory apparatus. (See Fig. 40.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_202.jpg" width="300" height="166" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span>&mdash;Larva of the &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>&mdash;Larva of
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellula depressa</i>. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agarion virgo</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Well, then, what is the name of this most singular creature, this
masked knight?</p>

<p>It is the larva of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libellula depressa</i>; the dismal envelope
whence will issue the gaudy Dragon-fly. Listen to a graphic description
of the mask you are looking at:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Conceive your under-lip to be horny instead of fleshy, and
to be elongated perpendicularly downwards, so as to wrap
over your chin and extend to its bottom; that this elongation
is there expanded into a triangular convex plate attached to
it by a joint, so as to bend upwards again and fold over the
face as high as the nose, concealing not only the chin and the
first-mentioned elongation, but the mouth and part of the
cheeks; conceive, moreover, that to the end of this last-mentioned
plate are fixed two other convex ones, so broad as
to cover the nose and temples; that these can open at pleasure
transversely, like a pair of jaws, so as to expose the nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and mouth, and that their inner edges, where they meet, are
cut into numerous short teeth, or spines, or armed with one
or more sharp claws;&mdash;you will then have as accurate an idea
as any powers of description can give you of the strange conformation
of the under-lip of the larva of those insects, which
conceals the mouth and face precisely as I have supposed a
similar construction of <em>your</em> lip would do yours. When at
rest, this mask applies closely to and covers the face; when
they would make use of it, they unfold it like an arm, catch
the prey at which they aim by means of the mandibuliform
plates, and then partly refold it, so as to hold the prey to the
mouth in the most convenient position for the operation of
the two pairs of jaws with which they are provided."</p>

<p>And so the creature I have been examining is only a larva!
How strange to compare it,&mdash;thick, ugly, unwieldy,&mdash;with the
insect that issues from it, so aërial, so graceful, so light, so
beautiful! The more I think of the contrast, the more it
interests me.</p>

<p>This larva, however, has all the characteristics of a perfect
insect, and I will wager that more than one observer has
described it as such, and classified it among aquatic insects.
Yet it is but a larva! And each species has its own special
larva (see Figs. 40 and 41).</p>

<p>This seems to me as difficult to believe as if you told me that
John, James, Peter,&mdash;in fact, all men,&mdash;were only temporary
bodies from which more perfect beings would one day emerge. For the
medium in which these masked creatures live,&mdash;the
troubled and muddy medium for which they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
adapted by their organisation, and in which they seem destined to live
out their life,&mdash;differs wholly and absolutely from the aërial
medium wherein, you tell me, they will one day rejoice.</p>

<p>Do you see, on the brink of the pond, those dried-up bodies? They
are those of your aquatic insects, the mortal remains of Libellulites;
they have rent open their vest, as you would do a garment which had
become too narrow; the rent is very conspicuous along the back;
and through the fissure issue the winged and aërial resuscitated
Dragon-flies, summoned to live in a world differing so widely from
their former one! Under the tongues were folded up the wings, and
the mask that puzzled you so greatly is split open on the level of
the sutures, so as to represent a &#10201;, wanting only a handle to
reproduce one of those hieroglyphics (&#9765;) which are found so
frequently on the Egyptian monuments, and which, according to some
Egyptologists, signify <em>eternal life</em>.</p>

and regular return of the seasons, all the
phenomena observable upon the earth, are but the
effects of a cause which we must seek in the heavens.
It is impossible to explain <em>them</em> unless we contemplate
<em>it</em> on high, relegating our planet into the great chorus
of the worlds, where it holds but a modest rank. Only,
to perform this miracle, we must for a moment repress
in ourselves the senses which deceive us by their
exaggeration or appearances, and give free course to
enlightened thought. It is by this means alone that
we can succeed in fully demonstrating the close and
perpetual relationship which exists between our planet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and the other spheres composing what we call the Solar
System.</p>


<p class="p1a">Permit us here a parenthesis, or, shall we say, a digression?</p>

<p>The whole secret of science, the whole secret of human
knowledge&mdash;in truth, the whole future of humanity&mdash;lies in
these two words&mdash;<em>Enlightened Thought</em>.</p>

<p>And here, gentle reader, I solicit your assistance in endeavouring
to elucidate a question which has a for a long time
puzzled me. Why do we apply the word "light" to that
which sets in motion the eye of the body, and to that which
induces the operation of the eye of the mind,&mdash;to the singularly
mysterious physical agent without whose intervention
all the external world would be to man a dream or a void,
as well as to the still more mysterious moral agent which
illuminates the world within?</p>

<p>I anticipate your answer. "The light," you say, "which
opens up to me the material world is a reality; the other is
only an image."</p>

<p>And it is true that this is the solution which first presents
itself to the mind. But the longer you reflect upon it, the
more you will be inclined to agree with me that it is unsatisfactory.
What, then, means this agreement among all peoples,
past and present, to designate by the same words&mdash;as</p>

<p>&mdash;those actions, processes, or operations which take place or
are produced in the outer world, physical or material, and in
the inner world, intellectual or moral.</p>

<p>Were your pretended "image" the result of purely personal
impressions,&mdash;all persons are not equally apt in apprehending
those fictitious relations which are the food of poetry,&mdash;were
it, in a word, no more than an individual conception, and,
therefore, eminently variable, I should not hesitate to accept
your opinion: we should simply be discussing what are called,
in scholastic language, the individual sense (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sens propre</i>) and
the imaginative sense (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sens figuré</i>). But there exists upon this
point an unanimous and universal agreement: all languages,
living or dead, attest it; it embraces the aggregate of the
members of the human family.</p>


<p class="p1a">This is the <em>first</em> point which induces me to doubt the legitimacy
of the proposed explanation. But I am confirmed in
my hesitation by numerous other facts.</p>

<p>Let us emerge from the domain of rhetoric to enter that of
experimental physiology and psychology. Too powerful a
light blinds the organs of seeing. No mortal eye, unless with
the aid of artificial appliances, can gaze upon the sun, the great
source of light. If the vision is to act clearly, we must proceed
step by step. If from a very light apartment we pass
rapidly, and without transition, into a darkened room, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versâ</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
we feel temporarily blinded: the eye demands a short
time to recover, as it were, from its astonishment. If we fix
our gaze for one or two minutes on a star of the first magnitude,
as, for example, Sirius, and afterwards turn away abruptly,
the eye will for a while remain insensible to stars of a less intense
splendour.</p>

<p>These are incontestable physiological facts, which anybody
may easily verify for himself.</p>


<p class="p1a">Well, in the psychological order facts exist which are in all
respects analogous. Take one of those truths which the
human thought, labouring generation after generation, has
taken centuries to discover or elucidate; place it suddenly
before an unprepared mind; however luminous may be this
truth, it will be simply shadow and darkness to the mind we
speak of; it will not comprehend an iota of it. Why? For
the very obvious reason that it lies outside its sphere of ideas,
in every respect comparable to the sphere of vision, beyond
which and within which there is no more room for the sensorial
impressions. There, as here, we must proceed gradually,
and arrange the transitions so as to produce the desired results.</p>


<p class="p1a">It would be easy for me to develop this parallel by other
and still more remarkable facts; but what I have just said
will suffice to show that the line of demarcation which philosophers
have, upon principle, desired to trace between the
physical and moral order, has turned the mind aside from
many fertile fields of research and speculation. Let us cite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
an example. The sun is the visible centre of light, heat,
organic life; in fine, of all the movements of our material
world. Yet it is but a relative focus, since the sun, with its
planetary train, revolves, probably, in company with other
suns or systems, around a centre as yet unknown; and as
there is no reason why we should pause in this cycloidal progression,
this second centre or focus of systems may revolve
around a third, the third around a fourth, and so on. Thus
we shall have an indeterminate series of relative centres; for
the term does not exist of which we can say,&mdash;there is the
beginning, or here is the end of the series.</p>

<p>We do not meet with the absolute in the material, any more
than in the intellectual world. Truth, by its power of attraction,
sets in motion all the wheels of our understanding; we
seek after it eagerly, in the doubt which torments us, in the
obscurity which surrounds us; we all feel the need of being
enlightened by it, and warmed, and revivified; we all are in
need of belief, and, at the same time, of possessing&mdash;let there
be no illusion in this respect&mdash;a certainty or demonstration
of what we believe.</p>

<p>But the truth which we think our own does not leave the
mind at rest; a slight effort suffices, in fact, to teach us
that the truth we accept depends upon another and remoter
truth, and that the world of thought is thus carried onward in
an interminable series of relative truths; unless we find it
more convenient to pause here at a primary cause, as elsewhere
at a primordial centre, which we may ever identify with
the primary cause. But is this truth, supposed to be final,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
capable of satisfying equally every mind? With this question,
dear reader, I close my parenthesis.</p>


<p class="p1a">To understand clearly the variable duration of the day at
all points of the terrestrial surface, let us so place ourselves
as to see our planet distinctly in front. I need hardly say
that this invitation is not addressed to the visual organs of the
body, but to the "mind's eye, Horatio." With the former,
fixed as we are on the surface of the globe, we can only see
the shadows of objects standing out in relief upon it, and still,
with the sun at our back, can perceive but a comparatively
insignificant portion. With the second, on the contrary, we
may detach ourselves from the earth, may mount afar into
space, may plant ourselves on some aërial height, whence we
may embrace, at a single glance, all the illuminated hemisphere
of our globe: we shall have but a single shadow on
the prospect,&mdash;that which our brightened planet casts behind
it, and which, in four-and-twenty hours, traverses
the entire surface of the globe, producing light wherever it
passes.</p>


<p class="p1a">Having completed our preparations, let us note what we
perceive with our eye thus disjoined from our body,&mdash;an eye
equally well adapted to fix every moving object, and to see
at any distance bodies extremely small, or bodies extremely
large. What a marvellous eye! And it is for us to develop
its power, and freely to increase its range. What an arduous
task!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>The luminous envelope, the photosphere of the sun, simultaneously
darts its rays in all directions, with an intensity
which diminishes with the square of the distance.</p>

<p>Let us follow those which direct their course towards our
planet.</p>

<p>So long as the rays do not come into collision, or strike
against resistant matter, they neither warm nor enlighten.
Confirming the Newtonian hypothesis of emission, they travel
straight as arrows through the icy space, the shadowy ocean
in which the waves of the terrestrial atmosphere are lost.
But the moment they encounter a material obstacle, the rays
partly penetrate it, and are partly thrown back, in such a
manner as to form a series of undulations like those which the
falling of a stone into a pond produces. As they recede from
these repeated shocks, the rays come under that theory of
undulation which Huygens promoted.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Let us trace the rays of light back to their origin. These
encounter first the globes nearest to the sun: the almost imperceptible
asteroids, which, on account of the solar splendour,
can scarcely be detected, and which, as yet, have received no
baptismal names. Yonder beams illuminate other revolving
globes,&mdash;Mercury, Venus, the Earth. If we here arrest our
gaze, we are influenced by a vague and mournful recollection;
the Earth was our place of sojourn at an epoch when thought,
formerly shackled, had become free. It is thus that a seed, removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
from the stem which nourished it, wanders afar to
diffuse and perfect its species. Our planet, of an ochreous
yellow, relieved with green and white, possesses no special
privileges; it shares in the ponderated movements of the
spheres; it is neither the largest, nor the smallest, nor the
heaviest, nor the lightest, nor the nearest to, nor the farthest
from, the sun. And shall Earth alone, of all the planets,
nourish that kind of "thinking seed" which we name the
human race? It seems improbable.</p>


<p class="p1a">But let us return to the great orb of light. It illuminates
exactly one half of our earth; the other half lies in shade.
And as the earth rotates upon its own axis, every point of
its surface is necessarily exposed to the action of the solar
rays. This action varies in duration and intensity.</p>

<p>All this I was taught, when I was still at school on our revolving
planet. I remember, too, as a lesson learned by heart,
that, under the Equator, or, more exactly, in 0&deg; 0´ latitude, as
well as at the Poles, or under 90&deg; latitude; the duration of
the day is equal to that of the night, with this difference, that,
while under the Equator, a day of twelve hours alternates
invariably with a night of the same duration, at the Poles a
day of six months succeeds continually to a night of six
months. I also recollect that, at a given moment, namely,
at the spring and autumn equinoxes, the duration of the day,
over all the terrestrial surface, is equal to that of the night,
just as under the Equator; and that, after these two epochs,
under the intermediary latitudes, between the Equator and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the Poles, the length of the days and their corresponding
nights varies according to the seasons; that, in our northern
hemisphere, after the spring equinox, the days increase while
the nights diminish, to such an extent that, at the summer
solstice,&mdash;21-22 June,&mdash;they attain their <em>maximum</em> of length
(and the nights their <em>minimum</em>), the reverse taking place
during the period that elapses between the autumn equinox
and the winter solstice.</p>

<p>I remember that I learned these data when I was living
rooted to or anchored upon the earth; but the explanation
which my masters gave me was not so clear as I could have
wished. Their considerations on the declensions of the sun,
on the obliquity of the ecliptic, on the necessity of exactly
reducing the earth to a simple point in relation to the distance
of the stars, to the end that the phenomena occurring
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">rapportés</i>) on parallel planes would be nearly identical with
those observed from the centre of the globe, or from a point
situated on its surface; all these fine things, which demanded
a certain faculty of geometrical intuition, left a curious vagueness
of idea upon my mind. I accepted them, under the
influence of authority, as beyond discussion, but I was by
no means satisfied whenever I wished to ascertain their
foundation.</p>


<p class="p1a">But now&mdash;in the regions of space&mdash;everything grows simple
before the mind, in which, apparently, all my power of thought
is concentrated.</p>

<p>Behold the illuminated atmosphere; it reminds me vividly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of the disc of the full moon. Ah, what exquisite iris colours!
They mark the meeting-points of the bright with the obscured
hemisphere: a circular line carried through all these points
would exactly separate day and night. On the one side,
motion and life and glow; on the other, silence and shade
and calm. This line <em>moves</em>, carrying with it in its movement
day and night, the illuminated and the darkened hemisphere;
it moves from east to west, so that the bright hemisphere and
the shadowy one, whose union forms what may be called the
<em>photo-adumbrated</em> sphere, revolves, in four-and-twenty hours,
round an axis which coincides at this moment&mdash;the 21st day
of March, according to the "terrestrial worms,"&mdash;with the axis
of the earth rotating on itself in an inverse direction, that is
to say, from west to east. Let us note this coincidence: it
is remarkable; inasmuch as, at the equinoxes, the terrestrial
equator divides exactly the illuminated and the obscured
hemisphere into two equal parts, one of which is situated to
the north, the other to the south, and their line of separation
coincides with a meridian circle.</p>


<p class="p1a">But I see another, and much slower movement, very clearly
defined. The axis of rotation of the <em>photo-adumbrated sphere</em>
does not remain parallel with the terrestrial axis of rotation;
it retires from it little by little, so as to form with it an angle
which attains its maximum at the summer solstice (21-22 June);
afterwards, returning upon itself, it coincides anew with the
terrestrial axis of rotation (the autumn equinox), to make an
angle in the contrary direction, whose maximum, of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
value as the former, corresponds to the winter solstice
(21-22 December). This movement, which is annual, complicates
itself with the diurnal. It is rendered visible by the
displacement of the polar shroud of snow: the portion which,
at the moment of the spring equinox, belonged, in the
northern hemisphere, to the obscured hemisphere, moves
onward, as a result of the inclination of its axis, to become
an integral part of the illuminated hemisphere; while, at the
same time, the portion which, in the southern hemisphere,
belonged to the illuminated hemisphere, moves onward to
become an integral part of the darkened hemisphere. Owing
to this displacement, the sun shows itself for six consecutive
months above the horizon, for the North Pole; at the spring
equinox it begins to rise, at the summer solstice it attains
its maximum elevation, and from the summer solstice it
begins to decline. Thus, then, we have in reality <em>a day six
months long</em>, of which the morning and the evening are the
two equinoxes, its noon the summer solstice.</p>

<p>In the same periods an exactly opposite order of things
prevails in the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>Everything, even to the minutest detail, is in this way very
clearly explained. Two facts&mdash;like the touches of a painter's
brush&mdash;suffice to impress the whole upon the mind, namely:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That, first, one half of the terrestrial surface is constantly
illuminated by the sun, while the other half remains in darkness;</p>

<p>That, secondly, the rotation of the earth upon its axis
produces day and night, by carrying from east to west the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
illuminated hemisphere, always diametrically opposite to the
darkened hemisphere.</p></blockquote>

<p>This being thoroughly understood, let us place ourselves
in the equatorial plane, so as to embrace at a single glance
a quarter of the illuminated and a quarter of the darkened
hemisphere. If the equator of the photo-adumbrated sphere
perpetually coincided with the terrestrial equator,&mdash;if, in other
words, the earth, in revolving round the sun, invariably occupied
the plane of the Equator, which, when prolonged, would
pass through the centre of the illuminating orb,&mdash;the diurnal
rotation would not cease to divide equally the light and the
darkness over the earth's surface, as is shown in Fig. 42 <i>a</i>,
where S indicates the sun, EE the terrestrial equator, and
N S the extremities (or North and South Poles) of the axis
which divides the globe into an illuminated and a darkened
half. This phenomenon of coincidence exists; but only for
a very brief period, and is only repeated twice a year,&mdash;that
is, at the equinoxes. At all other times, the equator of the
photo-adumbrated sphere, in whose plane the orb of light is
situated, passes sometimes above and sometimes below the
terrestrial equator.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>&mdash;S, the Sun; EE, the Equator; N, North Pole; S, South Pole.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But this alternate movement of northern and southern declination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
has its limits; it stops at 23&deg; 27' 30" on either side of the
Equator; this, too, is the maximum of the distance which the
imaginary axis of the photo-adumbrated sphere retires from
the axis of terrestrial rotation; it is at the same time the value
of the obliquity of the ecliptic, or of the inclined plane which
the earth traverses in its annual movement of revolution.</p>

<p>Fig. 42 <i>b</i>, which represents the photo-adumbrated sphere
at the summer solstice, will enable the reader to comprehend
with the utmost facility the six months' day of the North Pole,
coinciding with the six months' night of the South Pole; for
the triangle N C D indicates the amount by which the illuminated
moiety increases in the northern hemisphere between
the spring equinox and the summer solstice, the amount being
equal to that by which the adumbrated moiety overspreads in
a contrary direction the South Pole in the southern hemisphere.
The superfluous quantity of the photo-adumbrated
sphere is <em>nil</em> at the apex of the two opposite triangles, or in
the equinoctial region. And then, in effect, both day and night
are always twelve hours long. Starting from the equinoctial
line, we see how easy it is to calculate for each locality the
variable dimensions of the arc which the sun, in its apparent
course, traces above the horizon.</p>


<p class="p1a">To see very distinctly the portion of the illuminated hemisphere,
which, passing beyond the North Pole, forms a luminous
course on the darkened moiety of our globe, I have but to
place myself at midnight, on the 21st of June, in the prolongation
of the terrestrial equator; in the same way, to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
corresponding portion of the darkened hemisphere, which
advances beyond the South Pole to invade the illuminated,
I have but to occupy at noon, on the 21st of June, a point of the same
equatorial prolongation. Six months later, the same spectacle will
be presented, inversely, on the 21st of December, in the southern
hemisphere. See Fig. 43 <i>a</i>, where the pole N indicates the six months'
day of the northern hemisphere (from the spring to the autumn equinox);
while in Fig. 43 <i>b</i>, the pole S indicates the six months' night of the
northern hemisphere (during the same period).</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span>&mdash;The Six Months' Day and Night.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now, no effort of the imagination is required to understand
why the inhabitants of the northern hemisphere enjoy summer
while those of the southern are enduring winter; why it is
"blossoming spring" to the former when it is "purple
autumn" to the latter, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versâ</i>. Equally easy is it
to comprehend why, after the equinox, <em>day</em>, or the duration
of the sun above the horizon, gradually diminishes in one
hemisphere and increases in the other; why, in summer,
and in both hemispheres, the longest days alternate with
the shortest nights, and in winter, the longest nights with
the shortest days. It will not be more difficult to explain
the cause of the prevailing cold in the polar zones, despite
the prolonged sojourn of the sun above the horizon for a
great part of the year. Observe how obliquely the solar
rays are directed towards yonder shrouds of ice and snow:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
how can they warm them? They nearly all vanish into
space. (See Fig. <a href="#Page_202">42.</a>)</p>


<p class="p1a">Finally, there is not a phenomenon, even to that of dawn
and twilight, which cannot, on these principles, be very fully
and clearly explained. I have indicated, in a preceding
paragraph, the rainbow-glories of colour noticeable on the
line of demarcation between the illuminated and the darkened
hemispheres. They are wanting where the rays of light strike
vertically or nearly vertically. It is this circumstance which
explains why, in the intertropical regions, the crepuscular
phenomena are nearly null; why the sun, so to speak, sets
and rises abruptly, like a taper which we extinguish or rekindle.
These iris-gleams increase, on the other hand, in
intensity, in proportion as we recede from tropical regions:
the red touches the horizon, while the violet blends with
the azure of the sky; between these two extremes, which
are always very clearly marked, are arranged in less perceptible
fashion, and in the order of refraction, the other
colours of the rainbow.</p>


<p class="p1a">What time and labour does it not require for the mind to
disengage, to free itself from the fetters and incumbrances of
sensorial appearances, the illusions of the senses, and to rise
sufficiently high to seize at a glance all the dynamics of the
world!</p>

<p>It is this faculty, however, which distinguishes the intellect
from the imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>That he may abandon himself to the enjoyment of those
pleasures which, like Dead Sea apples, crumble to ashes on
his lips, the fool puts aside all mental toil, and disregards the
shortness of his time,&mdash;ignores the brief period allowed for
the development of the understanding. But, at least, let
Imagination abstain from substituting its idle dreams for the
assured results which can be only the reward of reason,
conscientiousness, and labour! Unfortunately, here as elsewhere,
it is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vox clamantis</i>, and we preach in the desert!</p>

<p>That the warning is true, all history attests. It is
only, so to speak, from yesterday that the discovery of
the sex of plants is to be dated; the tiny organs occupying
the centre of the flower having always appeared so
insignificant that they had passed, for some thousands of
years, completely unnoticed. The eye of the spectator
was caught by the calyx and the corolla; these envelopes,
though of secondary importance so far as the
reproduction of the vegetable is concerned, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to eyes dazzled by their glowing colours the true flower,&mdash;in
fact, the <em>entire</em> flower. Science, which is the slow
elaboration of thought matured by the study of objects of
no human origin, has completely swept aside this premature
judgment.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Perianth.</span></p>

<p>We have already, and more than once, employed the word
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">perianth</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> to designate the calyx or corolla, whether taken
separately or together. In the former case, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">perianth</i> is
<em>simple</em>; in the latter, it is <em>double</em>. A more appropriate word
could not be made use of. It is derived from the Greek πεσὶ, around, and ἃνθος,
flower; and literally signifies, "floral envelope."
Simple or double, this envelope is the metamorphosis
of several leaves, never of a solitary one, inserted upon planes
so closely brought together that they seem confounded.
Observe, in fact, how the leaves tend to efface their
intervals on the blossom-bearing spray; they draw towards
each other, they are apparently in eager haste to accomplish
their destined transformation. What eloquence there
is in this simple language of nature!</p>


<p class="p1a"><em>The Calyx.</em>&mdash;The outermost whorl, or verticle, of the flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
is called the <em>calyx</em>. And why? Out of a notion altogether
incorrect. It is true that this foliaceous envelope may often
assume the shape of a cup (in Latin, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">calix</i>), and hence that
the name has about it a semi-poetical air. But this only
occurs when the calyx is composed of a <em>single</em> leaf, which
has procured for it the special designations of <em>monosepalous</em>,
<em>gamopetalous</em>, and <em>monophyllous</em>,&mdash;three different words expressing
one and the same thing! The violet and the
primrose are examples of a monophyllous, monosepalous,
or gamopetalous calyx.</p>

<p>I see, dear reader, that you are puzzled by the word <em>sepal</em>.
Certainly you would look for it in vain in any classical
dictionary; it is neither Greek nor Latin. It was only
invented, scarce a century ago, by a Swiss botanist, whose
works have chiefly remained in manuscript,&mdash;by Necker,
brother of the celebrated minister of Louis XVI., and uncle
of the illustrious Madame de Staël. Let me explain the
circumstance which determined, I suspect, the choice of
this fanciful word,&mdash;a word belonging to no language but
that of modern botanists.</p>

<p>The botanists of antiquity called the coloured leaflets of
the corolla, <em>petals</em>. In this they were doubly right; for, first,
they are, in reality, nothing but metamorphosed leaves;
second, the word <em>petal</em> (in Greek, πέταλον) signified "a leaf"
as early as the days of Homer, who, when speaking of the
nightingale, says, like a keen observer of nature, that this
bird, on the return of spring, sings&mdash;</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The word <em>petal</em> was preserved by Tournefort, handed down
by Linnæus and the two De Jussieus, and afterwards adopted
by all botanists with the signification given to it by the
ancients. Now, as the calyx may also consist of leaflets,
which are generally green, Necker conceived the idea of
applying to them the same term, after substituting an <em>s</em> for
the initial letter <em>p</em>. Thus was created the word <em>sepal</em>. The
innovation, I must point out, was not unanimously adopted.
Many botanists continued to use the words "calicinal leaflets,"
introduced by Linnæus; others, though they adopted
the innovation, protested against it.</p>

<p>But leaving the <em>word</em>, let us return to the <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>The calyx consists originally of several leaflets. Is the
monophyllous or monosepalous calyx a transformation due to
the junction of the primitive leaflets? Observation replies in
the affirmative.</p>

<p>In the formation of junctures or adhesions nature proceeds
from beneath to above. Our language proceeds inversely to
nature: we speak of a lobed, dentated, or partite calyx, as if
it were primarily monophyllous, and its more or less profound
divisions (indicated by the words "lobed," "dentated," "partite")
were but consecutive results, produced from above to
below.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the calicinal divisions, which we call
<em>lobes</em>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lacinias</i>, and the like, are but the tops of leaflets united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
at their base. The monophyllous calyx (formed of one piece)
is, therefore, simply the result of a more or less complete union
of the leaflets composing, properly speaking, the calicinal
whorl. This whorl is originally <em>polyphyllous</em>; that is to say,
formed of several distinct parts. If it were, in the first place,
<em>monophyllous</em>, it would be impossible to understand how its
divisions are made from top to bottom, since nature, in its
developments, proceeds from bottom to top. In the final
analysis, then, it is an error to consider the calyx as a cup,
primarily formed of a single piece.</p>


<p class="p1a">Grew, an English botanist of the eighteenth century, seems
to have been the first who made use of the word <em>calyx</em>. "I
call a calyx," he says,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> "the external portion of the flower,
which enfolds the others, whether it be all in one piece, as in
the violets, or divided, as in the roses."</p>


<p class="p1a">If we wish to conform to the truth, as brought before us
by nature, we must revolutionize our terminology. Instead
of speaking of bipartite, tripartite, quadripartite, or of bilobed
and trilobed calices,&mdash;terms all signifying that the monophyllous
calyx is cloven more or less deeply from top to
bottom, we must say that the calyx in such and such a
species has its leaflets united at the base, or one third, fourth,
or half of its height; the <em>polyphyllous</em> or <em>polysepalous</em> calyx will
be that whose leaflets remain detached, as was the case in the
monophyllous or monosepalous calyx. This language, recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
by the authority of Auguste Saint-Hilaire, would be
more precise and exact: therefore, it will not be very quickly
adopted. One would say that the human mind condemns
itself to pass through the purgatory of what is false
and complex, before resolving to adopt the simple and the
true.</p>


<p class="p1a">If we admit the theory according to which all the organs of
the vegetable are the result of a metamorphosis of the leaf,
we shall ask what place is to be given to the calyx in the
series of these transformations?&mdash;Answer: The calyx is a
foliaceous transformation, intermediary between the bracts
and the corolla.</p>


<p class="p1a">It is particularly in the study of the calyx that the attentive
eye is struck by those proteiform movements in which nature
makes sport of our absolute rules.</p>

<p>For example: in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Berberis vulgaris</i>, the young calicinal
leaflets have less resemblance to the bracts than to the petals
of the corolla, and hence they have received the name of
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">petaloid sepals</i>. In other flowers this morphogenic wavering
inclines towards the bracts rather than towards the corolla.
We hesitate, therefore, whether we must give the name of <em>calyx</em>
or <em>bracts</em> to the three under leaflets which are visible beneath
the petaloid envelope of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anemone nemorosa</i>, or wood anemone.
The calyx of the Celandine (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ranunculus ficaria</i>), which
also flowers in spring, is exactly like a whorl or involucre formed
by the union of the bracts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>A similar embarrassment takes place when the calyx, in its
metamorphosis, inclines too visibly in the direction of the
corolla. Thus, in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Polygala vulgaris</i>,&mdash;a little, vivacious,
and very abundant plant,&mdash;the two inner leaflets of the calyx
are not only larger than the three other outer leaves, but they
are coloured like the petals, and become, towards the close of
their flowering time, membranous, herbaceous, and marked
with three strong veins: they resemble the wings of a butterfly,
and have been called wings.</p>

<p>These peculiarities are useful in the distinction of certain
species, which, at bottom, are simply varieties. Thus, in the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Polygala Austriaca</i> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Polygala amara</i> of Keoch, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Polygala uliginosa</i>
of Reichenbach),&mdash;a plant with small white or bluish
leaves, which is sometimes met with on the borders of peaty
swamps,&mdash;the central vein or ridge of the wings is simple, and
never anastomoses with the lateral veins; while, in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Polygala
vulgaris</i>, as well as in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Polygala depressa</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Polygala
amarella</i>, the vein is ramified, and anastomoses more or less
widely with the laterals.</p>


<p class="p1a">But since we are upon this subject, why should we not seize
the opportunity of familiarising ourselves, under the form of a
digression, with the little family of the Polygalaceæ? But no;
we will adjourn the episode, since it would cut the thread of
our discourse upon the calyx, our <em>calicology</em>.</p>


<p class="p1a">Some calices there are, which, by their colouring, approximate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
so closely to the second floral envelope, that one is always
tempted to call them corollas.</p>

<p>Such are:&mdash;The red calyx of the fuchsia;</p>

<p>The yellow calyx of the furze (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ulex Europæus</i>), and of a
kind of hellebore (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Helleborus hyemalis</i>);</p>

<p>The rosy calyx of the Christmas rose (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Helleborus niger</i>);</p>

<p>The blue calyx of the larkspur (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Delphinium Ajacis</i>); and the
Napel aconite (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aconitum Napellus</i>).</p>

<p>In the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aquilegia vulgaris</i>, and in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Trollius Europæus</i>, the
calyx, by the form and colouring of its leaflets, is confounded
with the second whorl so completely, that Linnæus gave it the
name of <em>corolla</em>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the midst of these waverings, which lead us
to mistake the calicinal leaflets sometimes for bracts, sometimes
for petals, we recognise perfectly the foliaceous type.
Independently of its colour, which is generally green, the calyx
has the same organisation as the leaf; we find in it the same
tracheæ and the same stomata, the same glands and the same
hairs; the veins and ramifications are also the same; and, in
more than one instance, the calicinal leaflet resumes the character
of a veritable leaf. Look, for example, at the five leaflets,
united so strongly at the base but so free at the top, arranged
in the form of a quincunx, of the hundred-leaved rose. The
two external, enlarged, and lanceolate pieces are garnished on
the right and left, and often at the point, with tiny foliaceous
appendages, which, in every respect, imitate the composite leaf
that carries the slender stem. And if we move aside the
external or bearded parts of the calyx, we see that the internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
bear less and less resemblance to a leaf. Thus, the part which
comes next is <em>semi-bearded</em>; that is to say, it is furnished with
foliaceous appendages only on one side; and the two upper
pieces are <em>beardless</em>, that is, reduced to the dilated central
vein.</p>

<p>It was these metamorphic forms of the free portion of the
calicinal foliola (united below) of the rose, which originated
a well-known enigma, conveyed in the following Latin distich:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>("We are brothers, both bearded, two beardless; I am two half-bearded,

<p>They are specially noticeable in a variety of the Rose of
Bengal, in which all the petals seem to be transformed into
calicinal leaves. (Fig. 44.)</p>


<p class="p1a">The part of the calyx formed by the union of the sepals is
called the <em>tube</em>: it is invariably the lower part. The upper
portion, where the sepals are free, is the <em>limb</em>.</p>

<p>Throughout the vegetable kingdom you will not find a
calyx in which the union of the sepals takes place at the
top.</p>

<p>This time, at all events, we have found&mdash;what is exclusively
rare in nature&mdash;a rule without an exception.</p>

<p>Generally, it is almost impossible to disunite, without rending,
the foliola composing the tube of the calyx, their union is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
so complete. This circumstance prevented the first observers from
accurately apprehending the composition and true development of the
calyx. There are cases, nevertheless, in which Nature&mdash;the
coquette!&mdash;suffers herself to be surprised, if her lover have
patience. As an example we shall cite the monophyllous calyx of the
&OElig;notheræ.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>&mdash;Rose of Bengal.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Let us take the species known as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">&OElig;nothera biennis</i>. It
belongs, with the fuchsia, circæa, trapa, and others, to the
Evening Primrose family, or Onograceæ.</p>

<p>Its pale yellow blossoms are unfolded during the hush of
evening-time in almost every garden, shedding abroad on the
breeze its delicate but delicious odour. Its petals open in a
remarkable manner. The calyx, as we shall see, has small
hooks attached to its upper extremity, by which it holds the
flower together before expansion. The calicinal divisions
gradually unfold at the lower part, and reveal the yellow
flower, which remains awhile closed at the upper parts of
the hooks. The flower then suddenly opens half-way, when
it stops; afterwards completing its expansion gradually, and
finally opening with a loud noise.</p>

<p>This curious plant is of American origin, and was unknown
in our country until 1674, when it was introduced by
some French floriculturists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>It opens generally at about six or seven o'clock in the
evening.</p>

<p>And this statement induces me to digress. Where can I
better introduce to the reader's notice a Floral Dial? It is
not so complete as it might be made if I had space to enlarge
upon the subject. My object, however, is simply to <em>suggest</em>;
and this brief allusion to the hours at which flowers fold and
unfold may induce the reader to study in more detail a
very pleasant branch of botanical science. He will find full
particulars in Mr Loudon's excellent "Encyclopædia of
Gardening."</p>

<p>It is generally stated that the first Floral Dial, or clock,
which showed the time by the opening or shutting up of
blossoms throughout the day, was a fancy or invention of the
great Swedish naturalist, Linnæus. But there is a distinct
allusion to this poetical measurement of the "fleeting hours"
in Marvell's poem on "The Garden:"&mdash;</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>Whether the idea first occurred to Englishman or Swede,

of our large public gardens.</p>

<p>After this long digression, we return to our Evening
Primrose.</p>

<p>Its large yellow flowers are disposed in clusters at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
top of a stem often twenty inches long. The Pythagorean
tetrad (<i>i.e.</i>, the number 4 and its double) predominates in all
its organs: 4 stigmata crowning a filiform stylus; quadrangular
capsule with 4 polyspermous lobes; opening at top by
the separation of 4 valves; twice 4 stamens; 4 petals on a
large, emarginated limb; 4 sepals. These are united at the
base, but not so as to prevent the observer from distinguishing
their number.</p>

<p>The general terms "regular" and "irregular," applied to
the calyx, as to every other organ, require to be employed
with considerable reserve. The delicate shades, which ought
to separate regularity from irregularity, are often so inappreciable
that it is almost impossible to say where one begins
and the other ends. See, for example, the Labiatæ. In
most genera and species of this family, the two lips, one of
which consists of two and the other of three foliola, bring
out very completely the inequality of the calyx. But there
are also Labiatæ, the inequality of whose sepals completely
effaces the character of the irregular bilabiated calyx.</p>

<p>In certain inflorescences, where the flowers comprising
them are very close together, as, for example, in the capitules
of the Synantheraceæ, the free upper portions of the calyx
may take the most irregular forms; as, sometimes, a tuft,
simple or feathery; sometimes, membranous or scarious
spangles; and, sometimes, bristles of greater or less stiffness.
What elements of the calyx do these transformations represent?
The veins, and notably the midrib of the limb of the
sepals, united underneath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>The free foliola of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">polyphyllous</i> calyx may vary in
form, like the caulinary leaves whence they issue by way of
metamorphosis; they may be oval, elliptical, linear, &amp;c.
Yet none have ever been observed of a heart-shape (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cordiform</i>).</p>

<p>Certain foliola of the polyphyllous calyx affect fantastic outlines.
In the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Delphinium</i>, the upper sepal is prolonged into
a spur. In the aconites it is hollow like a helmet. The spur
of the calyx of the monk's-hood (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Capucine</i>) is the result of the
united prolongation of these foliola. The buckler (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Scutellum</i>),
from which is named the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Scutellaria</i>, a genus of Labiatæ, is
a demi-orbicular boss formed below the inferior lip of the
calyx.</p>


<p class="p1a">The union of the calicinal foliola sometimes forms a conical calyx,
as in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Silena conica</i>, and sometimes a
cup-shaped calyx, as in the orange; sometimes, moreover, an urceolate
calyx, as in the henbane (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hyosciamus niger</i>). These forms may vary
singularly. The calyx of the black alder (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rhamnus frangula</i>) is
shaped like a top; that of the haricot (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), like
a bell; that of the tobacco-plant, or the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mollucella spinosa</i>, is
infundibuliform (or funnel-shaped).</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_237.jpg" width="310" height="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.</span>&mdash;The Henbane.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The observer is sometimes embarrassed in deciding to which
whorl he should refer the foliola he is examining. Thus, the
tiny foliola which, in the strawberry and the potentilla, alternate
with others and larger ones, are stipules rather than sepals.
Ought the sepals of the calyx in the Malvaceæ to be assimilated
in like manner to the stipules? It is difficult to reply
to this question satisfactorily. Take, for example, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hibiscus
Syriacus</i>, an ornamental shrub, better known by the name of
the garden-hemp. The inner calyx, or calyx properly so
called, of this Malvacea has five sepals, while the outer calyx,
or calicule, has twelve. Now, a leaf cannot have more than
two stipules, one on each side. For an outer calyx, then,
the proper number of foliola is ten, not twelve. To look
upon the second calyx as a "supernumerary development,"
would be to hazard a supposition contrary to the unity of
plan of the floral organs.</p>


<p class="p1a">The calyx, like the corolla, is not an absolutely indispensable
organ. Sometimes, therefore, it is <em>caducous</em>&mdash;that is,
falls off before the flower expands,&mdash;as in poppies; sometimes,
<em>persistent</em>, or remains after flowering,&mdash;as in roses and
the majority of plants. In some cases it is persistent only
until after the act of fecundation, but this act accomplished,
it falls with the corolla in most of the Cruciferæ and Ranunculaceæ.
This is a <em>deciduous</em> calyx.</p>

<p>The "caducity" and "persistency" of floral envelopes
furnish some valuable characteristics for the distinction of
species. Thus, two closely-allied Cruciferæ, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Alyssum calicinum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
so common in spring upon stony soils, and the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Alyssum montanum</i>, can only be distinguished from one
another by the fact that the calyx of the former is persistent,
of the latter caducous. It is true that the flowers of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Alyssum calicinum</i> are of a yellow which easily passes into
white, while those of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Alyssum montanum</i> are of a beautiful
permanent yellow. But this latter distinction is not so good
as the former.</p>

<p>The persistent calyx sometimes assumes a considerable
increase of very common appearance. For example, take
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Physalis alkekengi</i>, a member of the Nightshade family or
Solanaceæ. The red bladder-like accrescence surrounding
the scarlet fruit is the calyx, which, after flowering, has grown
much larger than it was before. And these bright flowers which
resemble large strawberries, and abound on the borders of
meadow-paths, if you look at them closely, you find to be
the accrescent calices of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Trifolium fragiferum</i>. The very
word <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fragiferum</i> reminds us of the strawberry.</p>

<p>The calyx may change in consistency and texture in proportion
as the ovary, to which it adheres, changes into fruit.
The fleshy pulpy substance of the apple, and, in general, of
the fruits of the Pomaceæ, is simply an excessive development
of the calicinal tube united all around the ovary, and
recognisable in the pips, imprisoned, towards the centre, in
horny lobes. In other plants, as the flower develops into
fruit, the calyx becomes woody: such is the case with the
Water Chestnut (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Trappa natans</i>).</p>

<p>Finally, the calyx may even contribute to the dissemination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of the seed. We may cite, as an example, a Brazilian species
of Urticaceæ, which Saint-Hilaire named the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Elasticaria</i>. The
fleshy and cylindrical parts of the calyx are curved inwards,
and thus defend, as one might do with one's bended fingers,
the young fruit until it is completely developed; as soon as
the fruit is ripe, they spring up erect, and launch it to a
distance.</p>


<p class="p1a"><em>The Corolla.</em>&mdash;If from the circumference we proceed to the
centre of the flower, the calyx being the first, the <em>corolla</em> will
be its second envelope.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, we proceed from the centre to the circumference,
the corolla will form the fourth whorl; the pistil
(consisting of stigmata, stylus, and ovary) being the first;
the nectariferous disc (often wanting) the second; and the
stamens the third whorl. Remarkable for its varied tints,
the corolla, to indifferent or ignorant eyes, seems the entire
flower.</p>

<p>A black or blackish colour is exceedingly rare. Out of 300
vegetable species which compose the flora of Central Europe,
there are not six with blackish or even grayish flowers. No
hypothesis has yet been put forward to explain this mark-worthy
rarity.</p>

<p>Species with a yellow corolla are the most numerous, forming
more than a sixth of the European flora: then come, in
their order of frequency, species with green, white, red, and
blue flowers; the white increasing in number as we approach
the Pole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Dividing the flora into twenty parts, we may ascribe to each
colour, and its various tints, the following proportion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Yellow, &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td align="left">6.0</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Black,</td><td align="left">0.50</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The analogy between the parts or <em>petals</em> of the corolla and
the leaf, is perhaps not quite so striking as between the leaf
and the <em>sepals</em> of the calyx. The phrase "rose-leaves" is an
expression consecrated by immemorial usage. Why not prefer
the term "corollary leaves or leaflets (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">foliola</i>)" to that of
petals?</p>

<p>The corollary leaves, or petals, are organised like true leaves.
They have the same system of venation; their <em>lamina</em> correspond
to the "limb," or "blade;" and their <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">unguis</i>, or "claw,"
to the "petiole," or stalk. (See Fig. 46, <i>a</i>.)
The upper margin of petals is frequently
more obtuse than the overspreading margin
of the blade of a leaf, which, in most
cases, is pointed. Non-<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">unguiculate</i> petals
represent the <em>sessile</em> leaves. (Fig. 46, <i>b</i>.)
Their form is much more varied than that
of the calicinal foliola, which are never unguiculate or petiolated.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 305px;">
<img src="images/i_241.jpg" width="305" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 46</span>, <i>a</i>.&mdash;Unguis of the
Corolla.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 46</span>, <i>b</i>.&mdash;A Sessile
Petal.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The petal is defined as <em>regular</em> when its two halves,
folded one upon another at the midrib, exactly cover each
other; in the opposite case it is called <em>irregular</em>. In certain
species, the petals are furnished with characteristic appendages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
But observe, these appendages, which generally affect
the form of a spur, have no character of generality. Thus,
for example, in the violet, a single petal is prolonged into a
spur below its point of attachment; in larkspur, and the other
<em>Delphiniums</em>, there are two which terminate in the same manner;
in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aquilegia vulgaris</i>, all the petals are <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">calcarate</i>
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">calcar</i>, a spur).</p>

<p>According as the veins of the petal proceed in a straight
or curved direction, its limb may be flat, or concave, or hollowed
like a boat&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, <em>cymbiform</em> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cymba</i>, a boat), or <em>naviculate</em>
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">navis</i>, a ship), or like a spoon, <em>cochleariform</em> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cochleare</i>, a spoon).
When the spur is very short, as in Antirrhinum and Valerian,
the corolla or petal is termed <em>gibbous</em> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">gibbus</i>, a swelling), or
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">saccate</i> at the base.</p>

<p>If a petal continue narrow, so as to seem formed by the
prolongation of the claw, it is called <em>linear</em>; if the limb be
prolonged below, so as to form two lobes, it is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cordate</i>, as in
<em>Genista caudicans</em>; or if the lobes be acute, it may be <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sagittate</i>
or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">hastate</i>.</p>


<p class="p1a">The <em>number</em> of petals varies from two to twelve, and more.
A corolla with a single petal, <em>unipetalous</em>, which we must not
confound with the <em>monopetalous</em> corolla, is a monstrosity, created
by defective development; the other petals or foliola are
abortive. A corolla with two petals, or <em>dipetalous</em>, as in
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Circæa Lutetiana</i>, is rare. A <em>tripetalous</em> corolla occurs only
when the calyx has likewise three foliola. But in this instance
opinions are divided: the majority will not admit more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
than a single floral envelope,&mdash;a perianth of six foliola, of
which three, herbaceous and internal, alternate with three
petaloid and external.</p>

<p>Many of our aquatic plants may be quoted as examples:
such as the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Butomus umbellatus</i>, or flowering rush; the little
frog-bit, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hydrocharis morsus ranæ</i>; and the water plantain,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Alisma plantago</i>.</p>

<p>The <em>tetrapetalous</em> (or four-petalled) corolla is usually arranged
like a cross, and is much more frequent than the <em>dipetalous</em> or
<em>tripetalous</em>; for examples, we need only refer to the large and
important family of the Cruciferæ.</p>

<p>The number five (<em>pentapetalous</em>) is still more common; but
we meet with it in other organs besides petals, and it seems
particularly characteristic of the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>Thus, all the Umbelliferæ have five sepals, five petals, and
five stamens; in all the Crassulaceæ, the number five applies,
not only to the sepals and the petals, as well as to the stamens,
but also to the carpels which compose the ovary.</p>

<p>Corollas with six, eight, nine, ten, or twelve petals are relatively
rarer; and when the petals become so numerous that
we cannot count them, we have to deal with transformations
of stamens into petals, with those monstrosities of cultivation
which we call double flowers, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">flores pleni</i>, where all the male
organs have disappeared,&mdash;flowers wholly unfit for fructification.</p>

<p>The petals of the corolla are not always free. Like those
of the calyx, they may be attached to one another by their
edges, but this union invariably takes place, as in the former,
from bottom to top. Therefore, we never see any petals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
united at the top, and disengaged at the bottom (see Fig. 47, <i>a</i>.) But
the reader must take careful note that this invariable characteristic
is not peculiar only to the floral envelopes; it is not met with in
the stamens, for these may be united, either by their anthers, as in
the whole family of the Synantheræ, or by their filaments, as in the
Leguminosæ. And what we have said of the stamens applies also to the
parts constituting the pistil. This radical difference between the
perianth and the true reproductive organs ought, from the beginning,
to have fixed the attention of botanists on the centripetal and
centrifugal metamorphosis of the leaf, which we have spoken of in "The
Circle of the Year."</p>

</div>

<p class="p1a">In many plants we are permitted to follow step by step,
as it were, the union of the petals, and their definitive transformation
into what is called the <em>monopetalous</em> corolla. The
term <em>monopetaloid</em> ought then to be rejected, if we are to
believe that the <em>monopetalous</em> corolla is the result of the metamorphosis
of a single leaf. The word <em>gamopetalous</em>, or, rather,
<em>gamophyllous</em>, is preferable. As we have remarked in reference
to the calyx, we shall here repeat that the expressions
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bilobed</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">trilobed</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quadrilobed</i>, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bipartite</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tripartite</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quadripartite</i>
corollas, are radically vicious, because they are the consequence
of a false point of view, according to which the <em>monopetalous</em>
corolla will be simply a single metamorphosed leaf, susceptible
of being more or less deeply divided from top to bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The polypetalous corolla, as well as the gamophyllous
corolla, may be regular or irregular, according as the foliola
are equally or unequally united. But here again we must be
careful not to lay down too absolute rules. Examine, for
instance, the gamophyllous corolla of the gentians; their two
lobes are very unequal, and yet the corolla is regular: five
very large lobes alternate with five very small, in such wise
that each of the latter is situated between two larger lobes.
Each division of the corolla of the periwinkle is irregular,
and yet the aggregate of their divisions is regular: these are
all of the same form and the same size.</p>

<p>In the gamophyllous corolla we are able to discern, through
the different forms it assumes, the form of the parts which
compose the union. Thus, for example, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tubulate</i> corolla
supposes the pre-existence of unguiculate petals.</p>


<p class="p1a">Inequality of union produces the <em>bilabiate</em> corolla, which is
invariably tubular. This is the case in the natural family of
the Labiatæ. The upper lip is composed of two petals, and
the lower of three. The parts of the upper are sometimes
so closely joined that they appear to be but one, as in the
<em>Lamium</em>; and the lower often becomes quadrilobed by the
division of the middle petal, as in the <em>Stæcha</em>.</p>

<p>In the labiated corolla, the mouth of the tube is open,
while in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">personate</i> or <em>masked</em> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">persona</i>, a mask) it is
closed by the pressure of the lower lip against the upper; as
in Snapdragon and Frogsmouth, the projection of the lower
lip being called the <em>palate</em>. By this feature the family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the Scrophulariaceæ is easily distinguished from that of
the Labiatæ.</p>

<p>In some corollas, the two lips are hollowed out in a
very singular fashion, as in the Calceolaria; assuming a
"slipper-like appearance," similar to what takes place in the
labellum of certain orchids,&mdash;to wit, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cypripedium</i>. These
<em>calceolate</em> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">calceolus</i>, a slipper) corollas may be looked upon as
consisting of two slipper-like lips.</p>


<p class="p1a">The forms of the bilabiate, tubular, and ligulose florets,
of the capitula of the Synantheræ, are likewise due to simple
differences of union. The floscular capitulum comprises the
tubular florets, and the semi-floscular capitulum, the ligulate
florets; the radiate capitulum consists of florets ligulate or
bilabiate at the circumference, and of tubular florets over the
rest of the receptacle. By considering the capitula, as the
vulgar do, to be flowers, Tournefort introduced considerable
confusion into the nomenclature of the Synantheræ.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span>&mdash;"Rejoicing in the shade of over-arching elms."</p></div>
</div>

<p>In your summer-walks, dear reader,&mdash;summer-walks through
green lanes rejoicing in the shade of over-arching elms, or
along woodland glades, carpeted with odorous turf,&mdash;you must
frequently have met with an herbaceous plant, whose purple-blue
flowers, arranged in regular succession, form the prettiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
coloured cones imaginable at the extremity of the stem and
branches. To this plant, the self-heal, we shall return immediately.
Perhaps you have passed it by somewhat indifferently,
for we pay little heed to common things, and on the
threshold of woods, and in their winding avenues, the self-heal
is very common. The celebrated German botanist, Bock (or
Tragus) bestowed upon it, two centuries before the epoch of
Linnæus, the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Prunella vulgaris</i>. The specific appellation,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vulgaris</i>, is here employed very appropriately, but we
should commit a grave error if we supposed every species
qualified as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vulgaris</i> to be "common." For example, the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Lysimachia vulgaris</i>, a species of Primulaceæ, is far from being
found everywhere.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_248.jpg" width="134" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.</span>&mdash;The
Prunella.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Pray, take the trouble to pick one lowly specimen; being specially
careful to take up the whole plant, stem, root, and branch. Lying along
the ground, it seems larger than it really is. Its root is a creeper;
at the level of the insection of the leaves some small shoots project,
the fibrous radicles which compel the lower part of the stem to crawl
like the bugle, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ajuga reptans</i>.</p>

<p>Does the prunella belong to the family of Labiatæ, like the
bugle?</p>

<p>See for yourself. The stem is quadrangular; the branches
and leaves composed of two lips. The stamens are four in
number, two of which are longer than the others; finally, by
means of a lens, you can easily distinguish, at the very bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of the calyx, four tiny seeds (a <em>tetrachænium</em>) grouped around
the style. These features indicate that our plant belongs, in
effect, like the bugle, to the Labiatæ family.</p>

<p>But mark the difference. In the bugle, as in all the species
of the same genus (<em>Ajuga</em>), as well as in all the
<em>Teucriums</em>&mdash;of which wild sage (<em>Teucrium
scorodonia</em>) is the most widely-diffused type&mdash;in all the
Labiatæ, the corolla is apparently <em>unilabiate</em>,&mdash;that
is to say, the upper lip is so shortened that only the lower is
prominently visible. This is not the case with our self-heal: it
is distinctly bilabiate. The upper lip of the corolla here forms a
positive <em>hood</em>, sufficiently ample to protect the didynamous
stamens (two long and two short), as in Fig. 50, <i>a</i>; the lower
lip is three-lobed, and the central lobe is largest of the three. By
separating the two lips, you can see the two short stamens fixed to the
base of the lower one, and the two long attached to the central part of
the upper. (See Fig. 50, <i>b</i>.)</p>

<p>Let us pursue the analysis of the flowery cone you hold in
your hand.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_249.jpg" width="300" height="137" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.</span>&mdash;The Lips of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Prunella vulgaris</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The least practical eye is immediately struck by the arrangement
of the parts and the variety of the colours. To recognise
these things more thoroughly, please to cast your glances alternately
from the top to the base, and from the base to the apex
of its terminal flower. A little below the base you will see a
pair of opposite, entire, and sinuous leaves, with shorter stalks
than any of the others. The base is defined by two opposite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
whitish, and nearly triangular leaves, with green points. The
top of the floral spike is likewise marked by a couple of bracts;
but these are much smaller, and red-coloured, like the two
leaves of the calyx. The interval is occupied by bracts, which
diminish in size from the base to the top of the spike; on a
level with each pair six flowers are inserted, three for each
bract.</p>

<p>The flowers, thus arranged by whorls, present some interesting
peculiarities. The lower and upper show only their
reddish calices; the middle, for the most part, display both
a calyx and a corolla, varying from blue to pale-rose, which
gives the plant a very peculiar appearance. In the under
flowers, the corolla has already fallen; by separating the lips
of the calyx, you may catch sight of the tetrachænium, that
is, the four-seeded fruit, which is developed at the bottom of
the tube. In the upper flowers, the corolla is not yet expanded.
It resembles a small deep-coloured globe; you may
say an eye, a bull's-eye, which, from the depths of the calyx,
regards you with a piercing glance. Hence, perhaps, the
French name for this plant, <em>prunelle</em>, an eye.</p>


<p class="p1a">We often meet with a variety of self-heal with a white
corolla, green calyx, and pinnatifid leaves, a variety of which
some botanists have erroneously made a separate species,
under the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Prunella alba</i>. It is equally wrong, in our
opinion, to convert the large-flowered variety into a distinct
species, by taking as its specific character the <em>lateral cleft of
the upper lip of the calyx overlapping the middle cleft</em>; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
this same characteristic is found in many individuals of the
common species. The <em>dentiform appendage</em> which the two
longest stamens exhibit at the top of their filaments is also
an uncertain feature; you must have recourse to your magnifying-glass
to see if this appendage is <em>obtuse</em> and very short,
as in the large-flowered prunella, or <em>sharp</em>, as in the common
species. As for the size of the corolla, it is, in fact, very
marked; but, as a characteristic, is wholly insufficient. The
creation of the varieties <em>Pinnatifida</em>, <em>Laciniifolia</em>, and <em>Integrifolia</em>
is no better justified. For it is no rare thing to see on the same
stalk, at different heights, pinnatifid, whole, and laciniate leaves.</p>

<p>The prunella is remarkable for the long hairs which garnish
the calyx, and, principally, the edges of the bracts. Examined
in the microscope, they assume the form of tiny, pointed
bamboos; the knots bulge out a little, and the intervals are
punctuated.</p>

<p>The botanists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
are by no means sparing in their eulogiums on the marvellous
virtues of our flower, which, by the way, Bock (Tragus) was
the first to figure with tolerable accuracy.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Tournefort thus dwells upon its medicinal properties:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It forms an ingredient in arquebusade water and vulnerary
potions. It is ordered in possets and broths, in
apozèmes for the spitting of blood, dysentery, hæmorrhages,
and the like. It has also been used for ulcers in the mouth,
and a remedy against headaches; after being mixed with rose-oil
and vinegar, the temples were bathed with it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Pharmacop&oelig;ia of to-day, however, it finds no
place.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_252.jpg" width="210" height="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span>&mdash;<em>Scutellaria
galericulata.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Scutellaria.</span></p>

<p>At the first glance, the Scutellaria has no resemblance to
the prunella. Yet the classificators have united these plants
in one small tribe, under the name of <em>Scutellarinaceæ</em>. These
are the characters which they give to them: Lower or anterior
stamens longer than the superior or posterior; calyx
closed at maturity by the approximation of the two lips.
The latter character is not nearly so marked in the prunella
as in the scutellaria.</p>

<p>The two commonest species of scutellaria in England are the
<em>Scutellaria galericulata</em> and <em>Scutellaria minor</em>. They do not
inhabit the same localities. The former, which is at the same time the
commonest, grows on the river-banks, and especially delights in the
mould accumulated in the hollow trunks of old willows. It is easily
known by its tender blue corolla, but especially by its calyx, which,
after the fall of the corolla, develops itself in a singular manner. If
you compress its sides, it will open so as to disclose, at the bottom
of its throat, its seeds, which are white, red, or brown, according
to their degrees of maturity. (Fig. 52, <i>a</i>.) Now look at these two
<em>jaws</em>: the upper resembles a small helmet (Lat. <em>galericula</em>), or, if
you prefer it, a judge's cap. As for the lower, it has exactly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
shape of a shield (Lat. <em>scutum</em>),&mdash;whence its name, <em>scutellaria</em>.
(Fig. 52, <i>b</i>.) Thus, the emblems of military and judicial rank
are found united in the calyx of our pretty labiate.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span>&mdash;Calyx of
the Scutellaria.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The second species (<em>Scutellaria minor</em>), rarer than the former, is
met with on the banks of ponds and in damp woodland paths. It attracts
your gaze by its tiny caps or helmets: the moment you see it, you
exclaim, "That's a scutellaria!" More diminutive in all its parts than
its congener, it is also distinguished by its whole leaves (they are
crenelated or dentate in the <em>Scutellaria galericulata</em>), by its soft,
rose-hued corolla, with brown lips coquettishly pointed with red, and
by its hairy calyx.</p>

<p>The <em>Scutellaria Columnæ</em><a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> is very rare. It may be recognised
by its erect stems and flowers of a bright violet hue,
arranged in terminal spikes and garnished with bracts; while
the flowers are axillary, and form no spike, in the two species
above described.</p>

<p>The <em>Scutellariæ</em> were first described with accuracy and classified
by Linnæus, who included them among his <em>Didynamia</em>, a
class of vegetables distinguished by the unequal length of the
stamens.</p>

<p>"How beautiful," says Miss Pratt, in one of her agreeable
little books,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>&mdash;"how beautiful are the little islands of the
stream, edged with the tall white meadow sweet, which sends
its perfume far up over the green lands that lie around, and
contrasts with the deep blue colour of the purple loose-strife!
The willow herb, or codlins-and-cream, as the children call it,
grows in perfection there; and there, too, bloom the little
yellow water-flag, and the vetches, and the rich water-lily,
which, seated on its round leaf, seems to swim over the crystal
stream. The water-plantain, with its numerous small pink
blossoms, grows in thick clusters quite down in the water,
mingling with the white flowers and large spear-shaped leaves
of the arrow-head, or half shading the large cup of the yellow
water-lily. Then, too, the blue-eyed forget-me-not covers the
little isles in such abundance that many of them well deserve
the name of azure islands. The water-rat hides among the
flowers, nibbling with much glee at the arrow-head, or rushing
out from under its broad green leaves; and the water-fowl,
followed by her young, sails across the stream in all the stateliness
of matron dignity; and the little meek-eyed daisy grows
beside the yellow velvet flower of the silver-weed, or the blue
blossoms and succulent leaves of the brook-lime."</p>

<p>The <em>true</em> Forget-me-not, <em>Myosotis palustris</em>, is invariably
found in marshy localities or on the banks of streams; but
the Meadow Scorpion-grass, <em>Myosotis arvensis</em>, is frequently
mistaken for it. The "genuine article" has a bright blue
blossom, much smaller than, but in shape something resembling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the primrose; in its bract it has a drop of gold, and on
each segment of the coloured portion of the flower is a small
streak or fleck of white.</p>

<p>Both the true forget-me-not and the false belong to the
Borage family, or Boraginaceæ, which includes sixty-seven
known genera, and nearly nine hundred species.</p>

<p>It is said that after the battle of Waterloo, a remarkable
number of forget-me-nots sprung up all over the fatal field.
The circumstance might well be made the theme of a poet's lay,
were it not for a suspicion that the little blue flowers belonged to
the <em>Myosotis arvensis</em> species, and not to the <em>Myosotis palustris</em>.</p>

<p>But why <em>Myosotis</em>? This Greek compound surely means
"mouse-ear," and what have these plants to do with the
auricular organs of mice? Why, their leaves were supposed
to resemble in form the ear of <em>Mus domesticus</em>. The name of
"scorpion-grass" originated in the fact that the top of the
stem coils round while the buds are unblown, like a scorpion's
tail. It is strange how quick the common people have been
to detect these analogies, and to perpetuate them in the appellations
they have bestowed on the flowers of the meadow, the
wood, and the green lane.</p>

<p>The singularly beautiful name of the <em>Myosotis palustris</em>&mdash;we
mean its common and non-scientific name,&mdash;is ascribed, in
a well-known German legend, to the dying knight who, having
ventured at a dangerous spot to pluck a handful of the bright
blue blossoms for his lady-love, fell into the stream, and as
he sank, flung the dear-bought spoil towards her, exclaiming,
"Forget me not!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>A more probable origin is suggested by Miss Strickland.
"Henry of Lancaster (Henry IV.)," she says, "appears to
have been the person who gave it its emblematical and
poetical meaning, by uniting it, at the period of his exile,
with the initial letters of his watchword, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Souveigne vous de moi</i>;
thus rendering it the symbol of remembrance, and, like the
subsequent fatal roses of York and Lancaster and Stuart,
the lily of Bourbon, and the violet of Napoleon, an historical
flower."</p>


<p class="p1a">We have said that the scorpion-grass belongs to the natural
family Boraginaceæ, which receives its name from the common
borage, a bright blue flower with very rough leaves. All its
members are rough or hairy, except those which, like the
forget-me-not, become smooth from living partly under water.
The black stalks of the borage burn, it is said, like match-paper,
and its root enters largely into the composition of
rouge. Its flowers were at one time held in great respect as
a wholesome bitter ingredient for a tankard of ale. According
to Pliny, "if the leaves and flowers of the borage be
immersed in wine, and that wine drunken, the potion will
make men blithe and merry, and drive away all heavy sadness
and dull melancholy."</p>

<p>Burton, in his "Anatomy of Melancholy," also says of it&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Borage and hellebore fill two scenes,</div>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the Boraginaceæ are weeds, but they include a few
ornamental garden-flowers; as, for example, the Peruvian
heliotrope&mdash;the "cherry-pie" of the children&mdash;which is well
known for the fragrance of its blue blossoms. Its Greek name
refers to an ancient belief that it always "turned" to meet the
sun; but neither heliotrope nor sunflower exhibits any such
devotedness towards the great "orb of day." The poet's
comparison&mdash;</p>

<p>is very pretty and suggestive, but unfortunately it is not true.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Lilies.</span></p>

<p>Are we justified in classing these among our summer
flowers? Well, the lily of the valley may, perhaps, be more
justly claimed by Spring, as it generally unveils its beauty in
the month of May; but the water-lily belongs to Summer;
and, at all events, it will be most convenient to speak of them
in this category.</p>

<p>The lily of the valley (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Convallaria majalis</i>),&mdash;the May-lily
of old writers,&mdash;has long been a favourite type of retiring
modesty and tender loveliness. It affects the silence and solitude
of the woodlands, where, in the shadow of broad leaves

</div>

<p>Our lily is a native of cold and temperate countries, and
never shakes its pendant bells at the bidding of a hot Eastern
breeze. It is very abundant in Norway. That agreeable
writer and observant traveller, Henry Inglis, says:&mdash;"It stood
everywhere around, scenting the air, and in such profusion,
that it was scarcely possible to step without bruising its tender
stalks and blossoms. I have not seen this flower mentioned
in any enumeration of Norwegian plants, but it grows in all
the western parts of Norway in latitude 59&deg; and 60&deg;, wherever
the ground is free from forest, in greater abundance than any
other wild-flower."</p>

<p>As it will not live in hot countries, it cannot be the "lily of
the field" which furnished our Saviour with so fruitful a text
for warning and instruction. This, in all probability, was the
yellow amaryllis, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Amaryllis lutea</i>, a flower bearing some
resemblance to our yellow crocus, but much larger, and with
broader leaves. Its delicate blossoms escape from an undivided
spathe, or sheath, and are bell-shaped, with six clefts
and six stamens, which are alternately short and long. The
flower seldom rises more than three or four inches above the
soil, accompanied by green leaves, which, after the flowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
has passed, continue to preserve their freshness throughout the
winter.</p>

<p>But some authorities are not content with the yellow amaryllis,
and put forth as the <em>true</em> "lily of the field," either the
narcissus, or the golden lily, or the stately crinum, according
to their several tastes.</p>


<p class="p1a">Not connected with these flowers by any botanical relationship,
and surpassing them all in beauty, is the <em>Water-lily</em>
(<i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Nymphæa alba</i>), whose large round leaves and full white
blossoms are the glory of so many of our secluded lakes
and quiet streams. Everybody knows old Izaak Walton's
quaint eulogium on the strawberry: "Doubtless God <em>could</em>
have made a better fruit, but doubtless He never hath." In
like manner I am inclined to say: "Doubtless God might
have created a fairer flower, but doubtless He never hath."
Alas! like most things rare and beautiful, its existence is very
brief! pluck it, and straightway it vanishes,&mdash;like a poet's
dream, the moment he attempts to realise it.</p>

<p>It is sometimes asserted of our wild water-lily that it retires
below the surface of the stream shortly after noon, remaining in
the liquid depths during night, and rising again into the light
of day at early dawn. Those who are acquainted with the
haunts and habits of these beautiful flowers know that this is not
strictly correct, as they may often be seen, "by the pale moonlight,"
lying folded above the water. It is not impossible,
however, that <em>some</em> may sink; and certain it is, that as the sun
sets they close their silver vases.</p>

<p>So says Keats; but this is true only while the sun is asserting
his supremacy in the azure sky. And then, the spectacle of
a calm, rush-fringed pool, nestling in the shadow of some
ancient elms or drooping willows, and brightened by the
uplifted cups of our delicate naiads, is a scene of surpassing
beauty. We turn from this favourite flower regretfully,

<p>Permit me, reader, another quotation. I take it from your
and my favourite, Wordsworth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Rapturously we gather flowery spoils</div>
  <div class="i0">From land and water; lilies of each hue,</div>
  <div class="i0"><em>Golden and white</em>, that float upon the waves,</div>
  <div class="i0">And court the wind."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The lily of golden hue, the <em>yellow water-lily</em>, is the <em>Nuphar
lutea</em> of botanists. The country people, on account of its
peculiar scent, most unpoetically call it "brandy-bottle." It
is far more plentiful than the regal nymphæa; its flower is not
so full of petals; and it is by no means so handsome. Yet,
with its smooth, glossy leaves, and golden cups, and long
floating stems, it favourably attracts the eye. We are told
that "its roots are nutritious, and are frequently powdered
and eaten for bread in Sweden;" that, mixed with the bark
of the Scotch fir, they form a cake much relished by the
Swedes; in which case the Swedish palate certainly cannot
be censured as fastidious. "These roots are also burnt on
the hearths of farmhouses, because their smoke is reputed to
drive away the crickets, whose chirping is sometimes too loud
and shrill to be deemed musical." Assuredly this is untrue of
many parts of England, as the cricket is popularly supposed
to be "lucky," and no old country-wife would allow it to be
driven away from her sanctum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The water-lily of the East, the beautiful Lotus,&mdash;the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nelumbium
speciosum</i>, which is figured on so many Egyptian and
Indian monuments,&mdash;is rich in blue and red, as well as in
white blossoms. These are said to sink quite below the
surface in the evening and during the night shadows; whence
Moore says of them, with his artificial prettiness&mdash;</p>

<p>It was formerly abundant on the Nile, and the Egyptians
consecrated it to their supreme god, Osiris; but, with the
splendour and mysticism of ancient Egypt, it has completely
passed away.</p>

<p>But it is scarcely less prized by the Hindus, who have also
consecrated it to one of their deities. A traveller thus speaks
of the sacred Ganges in connexion with it:&mdash;"The rich and
luxuriant clusters of the lotus float in quick succession upon
the silvery current. Nor is it the sacred lotus alone which
embellishes the wavelets of the Ganges; large white, yellow,
and scarlet flowers pay an equal tribute; and the prows of the
numerous native vessels navigating the stream are garlanded
by long wreaths of the most brilliant daughters of the parterre.
India may be called a paradise of flowers: the most beautiful
lilies grow spontaneously upon the sandy shores of the rivers,
and from every projecting cliff some shrub dips its flowers in
the waters below."</p>

<p>No reader of English poetry but is familiar with Tennyson's
"Lotus-Eaters"&mdash;a poem founded on the old myth of a people
who lived upon the insane root that takes the reason prisoner,
and, beguiled by its sweet intoxication, abandoned themselves
to a state of dreamy repose.</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the lotus of poetry is not the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nelumbium speciosum</i>.
There is some difficulty in identifying it with any modern
plant; but the general opinion seems to be, that it was the
<i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Zizyphus lotus</i>, a species allied to the <i xml:lang="el" lang="el">Zizyphus jujuba</i>, and
included in the Buckthorn family (<em>Rhamnaceæ</em>).</p>

<p>The reader will be by this time aware that of the plants
called by the general English name of "lily," some have very
little kinship to each other, and others none at all. The little
garden flowers named <em>Lilium</em> (from the Celtic word <em>lis</em>, "whiteness")
are mostly very handsome. Ben Jonson, speaking of
the ordinary lily, says, very finely&mdash;</p>

<p>The white garden-lily is a native of the Levant, but has
become thoroughly naturalised in England, and is one of the
commonest but most admired ornaments of our cottage-gardens.
The old herbalists thought highly of its medicinal properties,
and pronounced it a certain remedy for the bite of a serpent.
It is true, at all events, that its bruised petals are an excellent
cure for any ordinary wound or bruise.</p>

<p>Our ancestors, among their other superstitious fancies, entertained
the extraordinary belief that the price of a bushel of
wheat in the ensuing season was foretold by the number of
white cups which crowned the white lily's stem, each cup being
estimated at one shilling. I opine that our modern farmers
would feel dissatisfied if the Mark Lane averages were regulated
by this simple standard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The common Turk's-cap lily (<em>Lilium martagon</em>) is identified
with the ancient hyacinth, the "sanguine flower inscribed with
woe." The orange lily (<em>Lilium bulbiferum</em>) is a native of
Southern Europe. When the Dutch were at feud with the
House of Orange, they were accustomed to root up this
flower from their gardens, as some solace to their indignant
feelings.</p>

<p>Let me now direct your attention, reader, to a pretty plant,
of very elegant appearance: crowned, as it is, by a cluster of
rosy flowers, it would not disgrace our well-kept parterres. It is
called the common Centaury (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Erythræa centaurium</i>). You will
never see it in the fields side by side with the <em>Delphinium</em>;
but in July and August will meet with it frequently on the
borders of woodland paths and open glades.</p>

<p>Would you create for yourself by the study of nature a
source of enjoyment equally pure and inexhaustible, adopt
a method of classification for your own use, and, to facilitate
you in the task, take for your types those plants which are at
once the commonest and most characteristic of each season.
Quite at your ease, you may begin your analysis by examining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the parts which, like the calyx and the corolla, most attract
your attention. The most rational plan, however, would be,
to commence with the seed, and to follow it through all the
wonderful phases of its life, from the development of the
embryo to the maturity of the fruit. Unfortunately, we are
all compelled to take time into account; time is so much
more precious than money,&mdash;it is the measurement of our
existence. Undoubtedly, the mind, with its gigantic strides,
like those of an Homeric god, tends to overleap the confines
both of time and space. But the senses, without whose co-operation
the intellect could not create science, never fail
to remind us that we are, alas! but mortals. By this incessant
appeal to order, we are under the necessity of doing,
not what we <em>would</em>, but what we <em>can</em>. And the part we really
play is, consequently, much more modest than that which we
love to imagine ourselves as playing.</p>

<p>But to return to our flowers.</p>


<p class="p1a">What see you in the little centaury which you hold in your
hand? (Fig. 56.)</p>

<p>In the first place, a corolla with five petals of a delicate rose-hue,
very pleasant to the sight.</p>

<p>Take care! those foliola are not <em>petals</em>, if you give that name
to the free parts of the corolla. Look at them thoroughly.
Your foliola are prolonged at their base in a narrow tube,
which is easily removed. If you had begun here,&mdash;if, instead
of proceeding from the top to the bottom, you had, in your
analysis, proceeded from the bottom to the top, you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
have acquired a wholly different view of things. You would have said
that the corolla is tubular, greenish, with a rosy limb, deeply
divided into five lobes. And in so doing, you would have run no risk
of deceiving yourself. The indications given by Nature herself are
the most precious; they are the lessons of a teacher who cannot err:
never pass them by with indifference or neglect. In your study of the
different parts of a vegetable, follow, as far as possible, the actual
movement of the sap.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '57'">56.</ins>&mdash;The Common
Centaury.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The calyx of our gentian has, like its corolla, the form of a
five-divided tube; which, indeed, is one of the usual characters
of the Gentian family.</p>

<p>But it is important here to take notice of this fact, because
it is not, as at first sight you would suppose, the corolla, but
the calyx, which encircles the base of the ovary. The tube of
the corolla stops towards the middle of the latter organ, and
nearly on a level with the linear divisions of the calyx. You
must be careful not to confound with these calycine divisions
the green foliola which lie around the base of the flower, and
which are neither more nor less than abortive leaves.</p>

<p>Now call to mind that the flower is an union of concentric
whorls, or of rings set one within another. The <em>staminal</em> whorl
and the <em>carpellary</em> whorl, surrounded by a double perianth
(corolla and calyx), are here composed&mdash;the first, of five stamens,
and the second of a bilobed ovary, surmounted by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
twisted style. We may now examine more closely the reproductive
organs.</p>

<p>The stamens are inserted upon the top of the tube of the
corolla, and if you look at the base of their filaments you
would be inclined to pronounce it a foliaceous expansion, or,
rather, a metamorphic doubling of the corolla. Suppose the
stamens to be the result of the transformation of the petals, the
filament would be the "claw," and the anther the "limb" of
a foliole. At least, theory would tell you so. But observation
will show that these are not petals changing into stamens, but,
on the contrary, stamens changing into petals; as is seen in
the sterile (or "double") flowers of many of our ornamental
plants, and even of some of our fruit trees. How, then,
shall we conciliate theory with observation? Look, and
you shall find.</p>


<p class="p1a">Observe the anthers which surmount the filaments. There
is something peculiarly characteristic in them. As they open
and spread abroad the pollen, they visibly coil themselves up
in the form of a spiral. (Fig. 58.) Owing to this twisting,
they are found more or less inclined upon their filaments, and
are gifted with a considerable mobility. Thoroughly to understand
the relation between the continuous anther and the filament,
we must examine the stamens before their expansion,
while they are still folded up within the floral bud, their matrix.
The anthers are then quite straight, and, with a magnifying-glass,
you can easily see how they are inserted, by the lower
part of their back, upon the top of the filament, whose (so-called)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
<em>connective</em> prolongation separates the two lobes of the
pollen receptacle. The anthers are then <em>introrse</em> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">introrsum</i>,
inwardly)&mdash;that is to say, their face being inclined inwards, they
look towards the centre of the flower, occupied by the style, a
filiform prolongation of the ovary; the apex of
the style (stigma) is thick, globulose, and of a
glandular structure. The fruit, resulting from the
metamorphosis of the ovary, is an elongated fusiform
capsule, composed of two lobes, each containing a very
large number of extremely small seeds.</p>

of the Centaury.</p></div>
</div>


<p class="p1a">The characters we have just enumerated apply, or the
majority of them, to the interesting family of the Gentianaceæ&mdash;a
natural group of plants, nearly all remarkable for their
bitter, febrifugal, and anti-scrofulous properties. The flowering
cymes of the common centaury are very frequently employed
as a substitute for the medicinal gentian, so well known
as a valuable tonic.</p>

<p>The medicinal gentian is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gentiana lutea</i>,&mdash;a plant
growing about three feet high,&mdash;which thrives abundantly on
the Pyrenees, and the Alps of Switzerland and Austria, at
an elevation of 3000 to 5000 feet. It is not, however, so
common now as formerly on the Alpine heights, owing probably
to its great consumption, but it is spreading into many
districts of Central Europe.</p>

<p>Frequent enough in the vicinity of Paris is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chlora
perforata</i>, a gentian remarkable for its glaucous leaves and
yellow terminal flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>Gentiana kurroo</em> of the Himalayas, and the British
species, <em>Gentiana campestris</em> and <em>Gentiana amarella</em>, possess
the tonic properties of the family. The <em>Cheritta</em> of the
pharmacop&oelig;ia is the herb and root of <em>Agathotes chirayta</em>
(<em>Ophelia chirata</em>), a herbaceous plant which flourishes in the
Himalayas.</p>


<p class="p1a">We must not omit a reference to a Lilliputian gentian,
the <em>filiform gentian</em> of Linnæus, and the <em>Exacum filiforme</em> or
<em>Cicendia filiformis</em> of other botanical authorities.</p>

<p>Its stem, from two and a half to four inches in length, is
embellished with radical oblong leaves, disposed in fours, and
short caulinary leaves, opposite and linear; the corolla is yellow,
the calyx has four triangular lobes; the stamens also are four.
It is this predominant number which has induced some botanists to
elevate our little gentian into a species of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Exacum</i> or
<em>Cicendia</em>,&mdash;two genera, of which the first was named
by Adamson, the second by De Candolle. As for the tiny <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gentiana
pusilla</i>, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Exacum pusillum</i>, we may look upon it as a
simple variety of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Exacum filiforme</i>, differing from the
latter only in its shorter and feebler stem, in the somewhat narrower
divisions of its calyx, and the tint of its corolla, which is of a
paler yellow, sometimes inclining to rose.</p>

<p>Botanists, or lovers of flowers, may grow as passionately fond of
gentians as some persons do of tulips or hyacinths. But it is not in
England or Scotland, it is in the Alpine pastures of Switzerland only,
that you can hope to satisfy your <em>Gentianomania</em>.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">An Alpine Excursion.</span></p>

<p>Permit me, dear reader, to set down a few hints, in case
you should at any time be disposed to make a pilgrimage
into the Golden Land, or El Dorado, of botanists and geologists.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_273.jpg" width="500" height="568" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span>&mdash;An Alpine Landscape.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Before you plunge into the Alps, you will meet, in the sub-alpine
regions, among the valleys which intersect and the
meadows which clothe the lower spurs of the Jura, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gentiana
campestris</i>. It is a plant of from five to six inches in
height, whose blue, five-lobed corolla, with its velvety gorge,
changes into yellow when dried; the two outer teeth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
calyx are elliptical, and much larger than the others. Your
attention will hardly be drawn to this tiny gentian among
the crowd of more beautiful and attractive plants blooming
around it.</p>

<p>One excursion which you should not fail to make is the
ascent of the Dent de Jaman,&mdash;the hieroglyphic summit of
one of those charming mountains which mirror themselves in
the Lake of Geneva. This classical, and, moreover, very
easy ascent, has the advantage of carrying you up a series
of terraces, so that the character of the vegetation changes
rapidly. The acclivity begins at the little town of Montreux,
situated near the point where the blue arrowy Rhone pours
its waters into the enchanted lake. From Montreux to the
village of Glion, you will be delighted to greet your old
acquaintances: the familiar faces of your native fields, meadows,
and woodlands. But soon a difference in the character
of the flora forces itself upon you. Species which are rarer at
home become tolerably common, as, for instance, the yellow
digitalis (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Digitalis lutea</i>), so easily recognised by its cymes of
tiny flowers. The vulneraria (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anthyllis vulneraria</i>) is as widely
diffused as the trefoil in our English pastures.</p>


<p class="p1a">A little above Glion,&mdash;a picturesque village apparently hung
over the lake&mdash;the <em>sub-alpine region</em> commences. Around
villas and mansions, nearly all inhabited by English families,
you will find in abundance the English mercury (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chenopodium
Bonus Henricus</i>), and in the shady hedges the narcotic Herb-Paris
(<em>Paris quadrifolia</em>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The apparition of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Astrantia major</i>, which resembles an
artificial or fancy-created flower, warns us that we are passing
beyond the limits of the ordinary flora. I believe that we
have no representative in England of that singular umbellifer.
The Alpine pastures of the narrow-ridged Mount Caü, which
resembles the back of a dromedary, exhale a fragrance like
that of the famous Swiss tea, so much extolled as a remedy
against cholera. The odour of the hay-lofts attached to the
châlets&mdash;true shepherd's huts&mdash;which rise at intervals along the
back of Mont Dromedary, is so penetrating as to produce
headache. The hay owes its aromatic fragrance to the musk-chervil
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Myrrhis odorata</i>), whose strong stems form such thick
luxuriant pasturages; to various orchideæ, particularly to the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nigritella suaveolens</i>, remarkable for the intense colour&mdash;nearly
black&mdash;of its flowers; and finally, to the gentians, whose
scent is strongly brought out by drying.</p>


<p class="p1a">The rich close sward which borders on the Dent de Jaman
provides the herboriser with more than one agreeable surprise.
You will be struck by the beauty of the flowery tufts of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Linaria Alpina</i>, rejoicing in a deep sapphire blue. You will
also have an opportunity of making acquaintance with a
campanula which is abundant on Mont Cenis (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Campanula
C&oelig;nisia</i>); its beautiful terminal flower, of a pale blue, is characterised
by the long hairs which line the opening of the corolla.</p>


<p class="p1a">Among the gentians, those great ornaments of the Alpine
pasturages, we shall direct the attention of our readers to&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>The purple gentian (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gentiana purpurea</i>), and the spotted
gentian (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gentiana punctata</i>). These are distinguished by
their plentiful appearance: their large oval leaves, and the
height of their vigorous stems, recall those of the yellow
gentian. The features which separate these two species are
not very distinct: the corolla of the former is purple without
and yellow within; that of the latter is of a bright yellow,
marked by spots of deep purple, which, however, are not
permanent; the calyx is campanulated, with upright and
lanceolate foliola.</p>


<p class="p1a">The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gentiana acaulis</i> contrasts singularly with the preceding
species, its stem being so short that one is almost tempted
to deny the existence of any; its large corollas, of a bright
celestial blue, lie on the ground as if they had fallen
fresh from a bouquet. We must not confound this species
with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gentiana pumila</i>, a much smaller plant, with a very
elongated calyx, which grows abundantly on the turf of
Mont St Bernard.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gentiana verna</i> and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gentiana nivalis</i>, with a corolla
of the finest azure, inhabit the loftiest points of the Alps, where
all vegetation begins to disappear. The former, or the gentian
of spring, flowers, in these frozen regions, in June and July; it
is one of twenty-four phanerogamous plants of the last vegetable
station of Mont Blanc. This station is formed by a series of
vertical layers of protogene, which separates the upper part of
the Glacier des Bossons from that of Taconay. The débris of
the rock, decomposed under the influence of atmospheric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
agencies, form, in the midst of the  <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nevé</i>, tiny flowering parterres&mdash;oases
in the desert, islands in the vast ocean of ice and
snow. There, sheltered by the rocks, and warmed by the sun,
and refreshed by the snow, which rapidly melts in summer,
these pretty plants thrive and grow beautiful, though their brief
existence is summed up in a few short weeks.</p>

<p>According to Charles Martins, the phanerogamous plants
which flourish at an elevation of 10,000 feet are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Pimpernel.</span></p>

<p>Accompany me to the corn-field; not for any discourse
upon the state and prospect of the crops, or on the comparative
value to man of wheat or barley, but for the sake of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
little red flower which shines like a star among the growing
harvest.</p>

<p>You cannot mistake it, for, with the exception of the tiny
chaff-weed, the smallest wild plant which bears a distinct flower,
it is the only scarlet blossom in the wheat-field, except, indeed,
the red poppy, which every good farmer seeks to banish from
his land. Mark me,&mdash;I say the only <em>scarlet</em> flower; for there
are several&mdash;as, for instance, the pheasant's eye, or Adonis&mdash;of
a deep crimson.</p>

<p>The pimpernel belongs to the Primrose family, or Primulaceæ.
It has a five-cleft calyx, and a monopetalous corolla.
Its stamens, of an equal number, are inserted on the corolla,
opposite its segments. It is a <em>meteoric</em> flower; so-called,
because it keeps itself shut during wet or cloudy weather.
Hence, it is known among country people as "the shepherd's
warning" or "poor man's weather-glass." And Darwin,
enumerating the various signs of rain, says of it&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Closed is the pink-eyed pimpernel;</div>
  <div class="i0">In fiery red the sun doth rise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then wades through clouds to mount the skies:</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twill surely rain, we see 't with sorrow;</div>
  <div class="i0">No working in the fields to-morrow."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It should be added, however, that if the rain continue for
several days, the pimpernel will lose its sensibility, and cease
to act as a natural weather-glass.</p>

<p>And here we may observe, that singular as is the habit of
the flowers anticipating rain by folding their petals within their
calices, the way which the Siberian sow-thistle has with it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
still more curious. This plant, during that clear weather
which most flowers affect, keeps entirely shut; but as soon
as a thick mist overspreads the earth, or a cloud obscures
the bright face of heaven, it begins to open its light blue
corolla.</p>

<p>Everybody knows, or should know, that when the robin
looks sad and drooping, and ceases to greet you with his
wonted blithesome strain, "foul weather" is at hand. Many
animals, by their peculiar habits, afford equally certain indications
of approaching atmospheric changes.</p>

<p>This does not seem strange to us; we account for it by the
instinct which every animal possesses, in a larger or smaller
degree. But the same anticipatory faculty is possessed by
several plants; they feel the increasing moisture of the air long
before it can be detected by ourselves. Thus, when a storm
is at hand, some species of anemones fold up their blossoms;
the fragrant flowers of the wild pink convolvulus wind themselves
together; the awns of the wild oat, and the sweet-scented
meadow-grass, stand in an erect position, and the
clover leaves are drawn closely up.</p>

<p>Naturalists, says Pratt, are unable to discover why some
plants should be affected by moisture and others not; but
the regular changes of these natural barometers seem a providential
arrangement to supply certain wants of the flowers
in which they occur. We may draw this inference from
the different positions of several flowers according to their
circumstances. Thus the poppy, when in bud, hangs down on
its stem, and preserves its petals from rain and wind; but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
soon as it is fully developed, and has acquired strength, and
the sun's rays are necessary to perfect its colours, it expands
to the full light of day. The violet, again, while its seed is
forming, shades the capsule by its purple corolla; but as soon
as the seeds are ripe, and they are required to spring to some
distance from their capsules, the flower immediately rises up
with the cup for its support, and flings abroad its offering
on the earth's maternal bosom. Adaptations of this kind are
frequent and striking in the vegetable kingdom, and surely
one is justified in regarding them as the work of an all-powerful
and all-wise Creative Mind. Look, for instance, at
the orchis: it grows on the ground in Europe, and is consequently
provided with roots formed of large lobes; but when
it festoons the pillar of the virgin forests of the New World,
its roots are formed of a number of fibres, so that they may
penetrate the bark of the tree.</p>

<p>But to return to our pimpernel. It was at one time called
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Centunculus</i>, from <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cento</i>, a covering, because it spread in such
abundance over the cultivated fields. Its botanical name was
afterwards changed to <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anagallis arvensis</i>. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anagallis</i> signifies
"to laugh," and there existed an old belief that a decoction of
the pimpernel acted as a remedy against melancholy, and a
provocative of mirth.</p>

<p>The seeds of this plant are very numerous. They are
enclosed in small capsules, and eaten by the birds.</p>

<p>There is only one other <em>British</em> species of pimpernel,
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anagallis linetta</i>, or bog pimpernel, which it would be
unpardonable if the botanist omitted to notice, so delicately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
beautiful are its pale-rose blossoms and tiny clusters of
leaves. As its name indicates, it is found only in marshy
localities.</p>

<p>The blue pimpernel (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anagallis cerulea</i>), though not a native
of England, is found occasionally. It is described as growing
in beautiful little tufts about the hills of Madeira, and enlivening
them by its cheerful colour, which may bear comparison
with the azure of the sky.</p>

<p><em>The Mole, the Staphylinus, and the Mole-Cricket.</em></p>

<p>Do you hear that noise? It seems to issue from beneath
yonder heap of pebbles at the foot of the garden-wall. Surely
the stones are moving; they seem to be walking alone, and
of their own impulse, for I cannot see anything to set them in
motion.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/i_282.jpg" width="101" height="200" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span>&mdash;The
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Staphylinus olens</i>.</p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Let us draw near and examine the mystery. "Ah, what a
hideous black creature!" It is retreating in a terrible state
of alarm, as if it felt itself pursued by some formidable enemy.</p>

<p>This "hideous creature" is known to French gardeners by
the name of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">courtilière</i>; to naturalists, as a species
of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Staphylinus</i>. (Fig. 61.) Its great and persistent
adversary is the mole: a mammal at war
with an insect!</p>

<p>Watch well, I pray you, the mole's movements,
which you can do the more easily that here, contrary
to his ordinary custom, he is wandering in
the open day; the light blinds him,&mdash;accustomed
as he is to pass his life in the subterranean galleries
which he excavates by his own labour. But if he does not
see us, he hears us; the sound of our footsteps was sufficient
to make him prick up his ears (if we may so speak of a mole),
and he remains motionless. Do not stir, or he will betake
himself to flight, and we shall lose an excellent opportunity of
being present at a very curious spectacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>He is now reassured. He recommences his man&oelig;uvres,
pushing before him every little pebble which he meets with.
For this purpose he employs his elongated snout, exactly as a
pig grubs among the uncleanness of his sty. But his next
movements are not of a porcine character. With feet broad
as battledores, the mole, while man&oelig;uvring with his nose,
quietly pushes aside every clod which threatens to obstruct
his progress. These sidelong, abrupt, and jerking movements
remind you of those of a dog, seeking with his paws to enlarge
the opening of the burrow wherein a rabbit has taken refuge.
The mole has thus the habit of a hunting-dog; and, to complete
the resemblance, he stops at intervals in his scratching, and
shakes the dust off his head. One is quite surprised to see a
little mammal executing the movements we are wont to regard
as peculiar to an animal much larger than he is.</p>


<p class="p1a">The beetle quits in affright the heap of stones where it had
hoped to find an asylum; it now crosses our path, holding
itself erect, with a menacing air, and its tail armed with a
forked barb. The mole follows in close pursuit: who would
have believed he could run so quickly? Let us bar his
passage, and study him at our leisure.</p>


<p class="p1a">The first thing we remark is his glossy hair, which is softer
to the touch than the finest velvet. Where are his eyes?
Blow aside the hair which covers his face. There they are,
and they resemble miniature pearls of a shining black.</p>

<p>How could Aristotle say that the mole had no eyes? To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
believe it you must read the assertion for yourself. And here
are the very words of the authority who, for so many centuries,
was accepted as infallible:&mdash;</p>



<p>"All viviparous animals have eyes, <em>except the mole</em>" (πλὴν ἀσπάλακος).</p>

<p>Then, as if a sudden doubt had seized him, and he were
frightened at his own statement, the illustrious Stagyrite
hastens to add: "We might, perhaps, strictly admit that he
has." But another change comes over the spirit of the
philosopher's dream; his hesitation vanishes, and he immediately
repeats and justifies his former assertion in these
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, carefully considered, the mole does <em>not see</em>, because
he has no apparent eyes externally" (ὅλως μὲν γὰρ οὔθ' ὁρᾷ,
οὔτ' ἔχει εἰς τὸ φανερὸν δήλους
ὀφθαλμούς).<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>These last words denote&mdash;I beg pardon of the manes
of a great philosopher&mdash;an absolute want of observation.
Evidently, Aristotle had not taken the trouble to <em>look</em>
before he made his statement. And do not think that
this curious indifference was peculiar to the great master of
the Peripatetic School; it characterises more or less all the
philosophers of antiquity, as well as too many who have followed
in their footsteps.</p>

<p>Pliny has simply translated Aristotle when he says:&mdash;"Among
quadrupeds the moles are wanting in the sense of
sight" (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quadrupedum talpis visus non est</i>).<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is a curious thing that both Aristotle and Pliny maintain,
that if you lift up the skin where the eyes <em>ought</em> to be,
you will perceive the organs of vision. How could they
remove the skin without distinguishing in it the eyes, like
black and brilliant beads? Did they practise anatomy, like
their own imaginary mole, without eyes? The whole matter
would be inexplicable if we did not take into account that
force of inertia which binds man in chains of iron, in the
moral world as well as in the physical.</p>

<p>To see, to observe; to retrace one's steps, that one may
see and observe more distinctly; is a labour repugnant to the
human mind. To create systems, in order that he may proclaim
himself a great doctrinal teacher, is the work which flatters
man, or the creative power of his imagination. Centuries
of effort are needed before he can disentangle himself from
his self-woven thrall in presence of the phenomena of nature.</p>


<p class="p1a">A striking peculiarity in the mole's structure is his hands,
or feet, with their five fingers, or toes, turned outward, and
their curious resemblance to the human hand. Few animals
exhibit a similar conformation. Everything in the structure
of the fore-limbs indicates the animal's burrowing instinct,&mdash;the
length of the bone, which corresponds to the human
<em>radius</em>, or fore-arm,&mdash;the breadth of the hands,&mdash;and the
bend of the arms, which are so fashioned that the elbows
project outwardly.</p>

<p>Does the mole's burrowing instinct lead it in quest of
insects or of vegetable roots?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the old traditional belief, the mole feeds upon
roots. From time immemorial, it has been looked upon as
an animal so destructive, that, in every country, its destruction
has been encouraged by large rewards. Well, this belief,
transmitted from generation to generation, owes, like so many
other traditions, its authority to its antiquity, and is devoid of
foundation.</p>

<p>The mole is an essentially carnivorous animal, and no
more lives upon roots than the dog or the cat. He is pre-eminently
the hunter of the white-worm and beetle; and
therefore, instead of vowing its extermination, we ought to
take every possible means to preserve and multiply his race.
These absurd traditions and credulous notions, wholly without
any experimental confirmation, frequently lead us to take
steps in diametrical opposition to our own interests.</p>

<p>Moles are particularly partial to meadows which are somewhat
damp, as, for instance, those where the leafless colchicum
displays, in autumn, its pale-rose flowers. In summer, the
fields are covered with mole-hills. It will be said, perhaps,
that these conical heaps of earth are injurious to vegetation.
But that will be an error, contradicted by observation. Meadows
besprinkled with mole-hills grow excellent hay, if care
be taken to level them; for the earth thus distributed serves
as manure. If they are visited by the moles, it is because
these animals find there a plentiful supply of the <em>rhizophagous</em>
(root-eating) insects, on which they feed.</p>

<p>The forest is also a favourite haunt of the moles. Apparently
they find, under the layers of leaves and roots, so rich in larvæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of every kind, the wherewithal to satisfy amply their insectivorous
tastes. It is the mole which generally produces that
rustling of the dry leaves the wanderer is so apt to attribute
to a snake or an adder. Stand still for a moment, and
patiently watch. Do you see that undulatory movement?
Thrust your stick rapidly into the uplifted heap. There is
our persevering hunter; he struggles hard to escape from his
terrible enemy, but, with a little alacrity, you will not find it
difficult to capture him.</p>

<p>Moles are among the most prolific of mammals; and, in
fact, were it not so, their race would have been long ago exterminated.
We may, perhaps, venture to say, that by multiplying
so prodigiously, they wish to do us a service in spite of
ourselves. How tender is the solicitude of nature for the
ungrateful human species!</p>

<p>To see the marvellous qualities ascribed to the mole by the
ancients, one would suppose that they had made him the
object of their special study. Yet, as we have shown, they
could never have watched his habits with any degree of
patience. They saw everything through the delusive prism
of their imagination. As a proof, we will tell you what they
said of the mole.</p>

<p>"Since this animal has been doomed to a perpetual blindness,
and lives interred beneath the surface of the earth, like
the dead, he possesses, by way of compensation, some extraordinary
qualities. His subterranean existence renders him,
of all animals, the most capable of religion (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nullum religionis
capacius animal</i>). To acquire the gift of second-sight, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
must eat the heart of a mole, while still beating, and freshly
plucked from the animal's body. To cure toothache, suspend
to your neck the tooth of a live mole. Lymphatic people
will gain in strength if sprinkled with a mole's blood. The
ashes of a mole are a sovereign remedy for scrofula; some
recommend for this disease the animal's liver, others the right
foot, and others the head. The earth of mole-hills, fashioned
into pastilles, and preserved in a tin box, is an excellent cure
for all kinds of tumours, and especially for abscesses on the
neck."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Such, according to Pliny's report, are the virtues of the
mole, as taught by the Magi. The Middle Ages adopted this
teaching, and even to-day, in obscure rural districts, you will
meet with superstitious notions which remind you of the ideas
of the ancient wise men and necromancers of antiquity.</p>

<p>We have thus summarised the natural history of our <em>hunter</em>,
let us now say a few words respecting the <em>game</em> he pursues.</p>


<p class="p1a">The insect before us is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Staphylinus olens</i>. Its study
has been much neglected, probably on account of its repulsive
appearance. But, conquering our repugnance, let us take the
creature between our forefinger and thumb. See how vigorously
it defends itself! Its forked appendage is not formidable,
it is too soft; but take care of its mandibles! With
these hard, horny, pointed pincers, it pricks the skin and
draws blood. Now, bring your nose close to the frightful
black insect at the very moment when it appears the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
irritated. Come! A little courage will conquer your new
feeling of disgust.</p>

<p>What do you smell?</p>

<p>A pleasant odour of rennet apples! It reminds me of that
diffused by another insect, much less ugly than your <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Staphylinus</i>,
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cicondela campestris</i>.</p>

<p>It is this peculiarity which explains the specific name of
"odorous" (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">olens</i>) given to your captive. As for its generic
name, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Staphylinus</i>, I have no means of interpreting its etymology;
for the insect's shape has no resemblance to that
of a bunch or cluster,&mdash;in Greek, &#962;&#964;&#945;&#966;&#965;&#955;&#8053;. But this last word
also signifies the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">uvula</i>, and, perhaps, by the effort of a little
imagination, the naturalist may trace a similitude between
that organ of the throat and the body of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Staphylinus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Staphylini</i> are characterised by a very narrow neck,
which separates, as by a kind of web, the head from the
thorax. In diffusing the peculiar odour of which we have
just spoken, they simultaneously eject a musky volatile liquid
contained in two retractile whitish bladders, situated near the
anus. They run quickly, elevating their abdomen like the
earwig. The antennæ, inserted in the rear of the strong
mandibles, are each composed of eleven articulations, of
which the first is the longest; these joints, rounded in form,
are arranged like the beads of a necklace.</p>


<p class="p1a">The Staphylini belong to that numerous section of insects
whose <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tarsi</i> are composed of five articulations, and which have
thence received the name of Pentaceii.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>In this section they form, with some other genera, the family
of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Brachelytræ</i>, so called because their elytra, or wing-sheaths,
are much shorter than the abdomen.</p>

<p>Our <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Staphylinus olens</i> is finely punctuated, somewhat hairy,
and of a dull black colour. Though very common in our gardens,
and wherever any putrefying substances are to be found,
its habits are not very well known. For if it were generally
understood that it is an essentially carnivorous animal, that it
carries on a determined warfare against the caterpillar, larvæ,
and especially the white-worm, far from seeking to destroy it,
men would surely attempt to increase its numbers. It is a
proof that the Staphylini are useful insects, that they are rare
in seasons when the white-worms abound, as was the case, for
example, in the years 1867 and 1868. The larva of the
Staphylinus is as carnivorous as the perfect insect, which it
likewise resembles in form.</p>

<p>To sum up: in every phase of their existence, the Staphylini
render immense services to the agriculturist. It is very desirable
that this fact should be generally recognised, and their
rehabilitation generally proclaimed.</p>

<p>The habits of the mole-cricket are nearly the same as those
of the mole. When winter approaches, it takes refuge underneath
the surface of the earth, and remains benumbed and
lethargic in its nest so long as the cold lasts. On the welcome
return of spring, it makes its way back to the light by a vertical
gallery, on which a great number of lateral galleries abut, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
said lateral galleries being the roads it travels in pursuit of its
prey. This subterranean work it executes with its strong fore-feet,
which are broad, and unguiculated, or indented, much like those of a
mole. Hence its popular name of the <em>mole-cricket</em> (Fig. 62, <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>These insects (of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Orthoptera</i> order) belong to the small
family of the crickets&mdash;a family closely akin to that of the
grasshoppers. This close kinship has been recognised by the poets, and
we find them brought together in a very charming sonnet, which cannot
be too frequently perused by any reader, and which may therefore be
introduced as a relief to our duller prose:&mdash;</p>

<p>So sings Leigh Hunt&mdash;a poet, by the way, whose heart was
ever open at "the feel of June," and whose genial writings,
whether prose or verse, whether delightful essays or melodious
songs, should be read in the "happy summer-time," when the
idler, reclining on the sunny grass, with the beauty of an
English landscape around him, wants the companionship of a
gentle spirit and a refined and healthy intellect.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The mole-cricket is, like the grasshopper, a child of summer.
It differs, moreover, from the "cricket on the hearth" in lacking
those organs of <em>stridulation</em> (excuse the word, kind reader!)
which mark "the glad silent moments" with their tricksome
(and sometimes inconvenient) tune. Their posterior thighs
have an apparent bulging about them, but the legs are very
short; so short, that our little friend could not compete with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
its cousin, the grasshopper, in vaulting exercises, even were it
not otherwise prevented by its large abdomen. Nor is it
much assisted by its wings, for though they are broad, they
are not organised for rapid flight, and the mole-cricket makes
but little use of them. Nature, however, has compensated it
for all these disadvantages by the gift of those strong, powerful,
flexible fore-feet of which I have already spoken.</p>

<p>The species generally met with in gardens, corn-fields, and
orchards is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i> of Latreille, identical
with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gryllus gryllotalpa</i> of Linnæus. It has a brown head,
garnished with rusty-coloured mandibles; the thorax is of a
brownish-gray, velvety, tinged with red in the fore parts; the
elytra, or wing-sheaths, which are much shorter than the abdomen,
are gray, and marked by black and conspicuously prominent
nerves; the wings, folded back like a fan, are about
one-fourth longer than the abdomen.</p>


<p class="p1a">The mole-cricket,&mdash;mark me!&mdash;is no more of a root-eater
than the mole; it is carnivorous, like the Staphylinus. As
an experiment in confirmation of this statement, we shut up
one of these curious Orthopteras in a large chest filled with
mould. Concealed in the galleries which it speedily constructed
for its use, it fed upon larvæ, and never touched the
cereals which we had sown in the earth. Here was a proof
that we had to plead the cause of another of man's victims.</p>

<p>The mole-cricket ejects, when pursued or tormented, a
blackish liquid, whose etherealised odour reminds one of the
peculiar smell of certain rotten apples. The female, larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
than the male, lays her eggs, which are, comparatively speaking,
of a tolerable size (Fig. 62, <i>b</i>), at some depth underground.
The young, when hatched, resemble their parents, except that
they are white, and possess merely the rudiments of wings.</p>

<p>If the mole-cricket, in its subterranean progress, encounters
any roots, it cuts them with its mandibles, not to feed upon
them, but to get rid of an obstacle; hence the mischief of
which the farmer accuses it, though this slight amount of injury
is altogether outweighed by its services in destroying a swarm
of insects.</p>

<p>Perhaps, therefore, we must not blame the farmer for the
hostility with which he pursues it, especially if we are to
accept as a true picture of its doings the sketch recently
drawn by a popular writer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is easy to understand that an insect which undermines
land in this way must cause great damage to cultivation (!).
Whether the crops serve it for food or not, they are not the
less destroyed by its underground burrowings. Lands infested
by the mole-cricket are recognisable by the colour of the vegetation,
which is yellow and withered; and the rubbish which
these miners heap up at the side of the openings leading to
their galleries, resembling mole-hills in miniature, betrays their
presence to the farmer."</p>

<p>If, I say, this be a true picture, we cannot wonder at the
means employed by the farmer to clear his fields of such dangerous
tenants. The plan generally adopted is to dig, at
intervals, a number of little trenches, which are filled up with
cow-dung, well trodden down. The supposed root-eaters assemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
in these warm nests; and every fourth or fifth day, a
labourer, armed with a pitchfork, scoops up the manure at a
single stroke, and scatters it over the ground, while another
crushes the unfortunate <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gryllotalpæ</i> as fast as they make their
appearance.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Earwig.</span></p>

<p>Next to the domestic fly, the earwig is, perhaps, one of our
commonest, and, let us add, one of our most troublesome, insects.
Whence comes its popular appellation? From a mere fable. To amuse the
silly&mdash;alas! how great their number!&mdash;marvelling, without
doubt, at the spectacle of an insect's tail armed with strong pincers,
some jester wished to transform it into a terrible animal; and therefore
he pretended that it introduced itself into the human ear, and from
thence penetrated to the brain, with the view of driving out its
proprietor,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the mind or spirit which animates it. Only,
the originator of this absurd bugbear forgot one little fact: there is
no opening by which the ear can communicate with the brain! As for the
pincers, they are not so formidable as they appear. This character,
however, has been considered a sufficient foundation by the naturalists,
even by Linnæus himself, for the insect's scientific name, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Forficula
auricularia</i>, which is almost literally translated by the French
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">oreille-pince</i>,&mdash;our English <em>earwig</em> or <em>ear-piercer</em>. (Fig.
64.)</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_295.jpg" width="250" height="163" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span>&mdash;The Earwig (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Forficula
auricularia</i>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>What dress is to man, their wings are to insects; by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
we distinguish them, at the first glance, from one another. The
elytra,&mdash;those horny sheaths which protect the membranous
wings,&mdash;embrace, in the Coleoptera, the entire upper surface of
the long annulated abdomen, and resemble vari-coloured <i xml:lang="la"
lang="la">chlamydes</i>. But now, look for the elytra of our Forficula.
You will hardly believe that they are represented by this kind of
abbreviated light-brown jacket, which does not extend below the middle
of the back. Do you observe yonder whitish spots? They indicate the
tips of the wings, which are longer than their covers. Lift up one of
the elytra with your penknife, and you will find that the wing which it
partly screens is worth your attention. The fore part (we should call
it the <em>upper</em>, if the animal walked erect like a man) is straight, and
without a fold. Raise it with a pin to see the posterior or lower part.
Observe, it curves underneath so as to bind the intermediate portion
like a fan. But this flabelliform wing,&mdash;of tolerable dimensions
when unfolded,&mdash;seems intended by the Creative Thought only to mark
its unity of plan: the earwig does not fly,&mdash;it secures its food by
crawling.</p>

<p>The elytra and the wings, inconspicuous as they are, produced
so great an impression on the early naturalists, that they
made them the principal characteristics of an entire order of
insects. De Geer, a celebrated Swedish naturalist, named them
the <em>Dermaptera</em> (from δέρμα, skin,
and πτερόν, wing), in allusion
to the transparent skin-like appearance of the elytra. This
name, though adopted by Kirby, has not been preserved. A French
entomologist suggested the designation<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> which is now in
use,&mdash;<em>Orthoptera</em> (from ὀρθός, straight,
and πτερόν),&mdash;referring to the manner
in which the wings are folded underneath the elytra.</p>


<p class="p1a">Here we must pause to recapitulate for the benefit of our
younger readers, and to avoid confusion, the various orders
into which the insect world is divided.</p>

<p>1. <em>Aptera</em> (from α, without, and πτερόν, a wing),&mdash;wingless.
Examples&mdash;Flea, louse, chigo.</p>

<p>2. <em>Diptera</em> (δίς, two, and πτερόν),&mdash;two-winged. Sub-divided
into Nemocera, having six-jointed antennæ; Brachycera, having
three-jointed antennæ. Examples&mdash;Gnat, tipula; May-fly, gad-fly.</p>

<p>3. <em>Hemiptera</em> (ἕμι, half, and πτερόν),&mdash;half-winged. Sub-divided
into Heteroptera, with wings of different textures;
Homoptera, with wings of one substance. Examples&mdash;Land-bug,
water-bug; cicada, lantern-fly.</p>

<p>4. <em>Lepidoptera</em> (λεπίς, a scale, and πτερόν),&mdash;scaly-winged.
Examples&mdash;Tiger-moth, butterfly, silkworm.</p>

<p>5. <em>Orthoptera</em> (ὀρθός, straight, and πτερόν),&mdash;straight-winged.
Examples&mdash;Earwig, cockroach, locust.</p>

<p>6. <em>Stymenoptera</em> (ὑμήν, a membrane, and πτερόν),&mdash;membranous-winged.
Examples&mdash;Bee, wasp, ant.</p>

<p>7. <em>Neuroptera</em> (νευρόν, nerve, and πτερόν),&mdash;nerve-marked
wings. Examples&mdash;Dragon-fly, caddis-fly, ant-lin.</p>

<p>8. <em>Strepsiptera</em> (στρεψις, a twisting, and πτερόν),&mdash;curled or
twisted wings. Examples&mdash;Xenos, elenchus.</p>

<p>9. <em>Coleoptera</em> (κολεός, a sheath, and πτερόν;),&mdash;sheathed wings.
Examples&mdash;Beetle, cockchafer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>The order of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Orthoptera</i>, with which we are now concerned, is
not very well known. The reason is, perhaps, that the insects belonging
to it&mdash;earwigs, cockroaches, grasshoppers, crickets&mdash;are not
less disagreeable than useless, so far as man is concerned. Being nearly
all of them omnivorous, like man himself, they frequently aid him, very
much against his inclination, in the consumption of natural products of
every kind.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that the species of great animals are far fewer
in number than those of the little. This remark applies with peculiar
force to the Orthoptera, which do not include nearly so many small
species as the Coleoptera.</p>


<p class="p1a">The earwig is the type of the tiny group of the Forficulidæ,
of which two species only are known to the common world&mdash;the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Forficula auricularia</i> and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Forficula minor</i>.</p>

<p>The first species everybody is acquainted with. We have
already spoken of its elytra and its wings; but we now say a
word upon the two extremities of its body. The two antennæ,
which crown the head, are extremely mobile, owing, of
course, to the numerous articulations of which they are made
up. These are fourteen in number (if we include the base,
which is itself composed of two movable parts). In reality,
however, there are but twelve; for we ought to eliminate the
base,&mdash;because, in form and size, it differs greatly from articulations
properly so called,&mdash;and, at the same time, to regard
as one the articulation or joint inserted in it. In fine, I am
of opinion, contrary to the general conclusion, that the
antennæ of the earwig consist but of twelve articulations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
bristling with hairs, and easily counted almost by the unassisted
eye. With the help of a microscope, the observer
can easily distinguish the large nervure traversing them from
top to bottom, and communicating to the antennæ their
characteristic sensibility and mobility.</p>

<p>The brownish-coloured abdomen, composed of imbricated
rings, forms, in itself alone, upwards of half the body. The
animal can move itself in every direction; can bend and
twist like a young eel. To the last of its rings, which is
larger than the others, are attached the two curved branches
of the forceps (<em>forficula</em>). These are weapons of defence
rather than of attack. At the same time, they are useful as
a sexual distinction. The forceps of the male are strongly
arched, and furnished with indentations perfectly visible to
the naked eye (see Fig. 64, <i>a</i>); those of the female are
scarcely bent at all, and their indentations can only be seen
with the microscope. In numerous individuals, the last ring
of the abdomen is provided with four tubercles, one in each
side and two in the middle; but this is not a uniform
characteristic.</p>

<p>The earwig is a <em>trimeral</em> insect; that is, its tarsi are each
composed of three joints. Its mandibles are comparatively
weak. The moment you touch it, the insect raises, with
great quickness, the extremity of its supple body, and endeavours
to defend itself with its pincers. The female lays her
eggs chiefly in the chinks and crannies of time-worn timber,
and the larvæ issuing from them do not differ, in any material
respect, from the perfect insect. (See Fig. 64, <i>b</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The small species, known as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Forficula minor</i>, is not very
common. It is about half the size of its better-known
congener, and is also distinguished from it by its joints, ten
in number,&mdash;by its legs, of a very pale yellow,&mdash;and by its
pincers, which are not only very short, but almost straight,
and scarcely marked, even in the male, with any indentations.
More, the wings are of the colour of the elytra, and without
any white spots. This species is chiefly met with in the spring-time,
and then in damp sandy localities, near ponds and rivers.</p>


<p class="p1a">Another, and still rarer species, to which we may permit
ourselves an allusion, has yellow pincers, rather black at the
extremity, and garnished inside, towards the middle, with a
horny tubercular projection. In the Pyrenees a species
has been found which has no wings at all, and has therefore
been named <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Forficula aptera</i>.</p>

<p>Our readers will now inquire, What is the use of this
curiously constructed animal? Is it not an abomination to
the gardener? Well, we admit that it eats up the leaves
of his plants, and the petals of his flowers, especially of the
dahlia; but, on the other hand, it destroys those far more
injurious insects, <em>thrips</em>, <em>aphis</em>, and the like.</p>

<p>But it has a peculiar interest for the scientific student from
the point of view of what we may call its <em>muscular dynamometry</em>,&mdash;its
power of traction, which is far superior to that
of our strongest quadrupeds.</p>

<p>Do you doubt the truth of this assertion? Try, then, the
following experiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Fasten to the insect's pincer, or forceps, with a thread, a
halfpenny, which will weigh about two grains, while the weight
of its body, on an average, will not exceed five centigrammes.
Give the insect free course over a sheet of paper, and you
will see it drag along the coin like a light chariot. Our animal
is, therefore, capable of drawing a burden fifty times
heavier than its own body. A man of eleven stone would,
in the same ratio, be able to drag 7700 lbs. Neither man
nor horse can enter, in this respect, into competition with
the earwig. If all the members of the animal kingdom were
classified according to their power of traction, it is probable
that the post of honour at the top of the list would be occupied
by our despised <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Forficula auricularia</i>.</p>


<p class="p1a">The idea of a <em>muscular dynamometry</em> of insects is
not so new as one might be tempted to think it. From time immemorial men
have been struck, without being able to account for it, by the enormous
disproportion existing between the weight of a flea and the force or
energy displayed by its extraordinary bounds. Hence the popularity of
a recent exhibition in London of Performing Fleas. Pliny, eighteen
centuries ago, asserted that the muscular strength of the ants exceeded
that of all other animals, if we compared the burden they were able to
carry with the diminutiveness of their bodies. "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Si quis comparet onera
corporibus earum, fateatur nullis portione vires esse majores.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, this interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
question was taken up by Borelli, Lahire, Buffon, and Gueneau
de Montbeliard. Recently it has been revived, with much
ability, by Felix Plateau, whose experiments have proved that
the insects, in comparison with their weight, possess an uncommon
muscular force, far beyond that of vertebrate animals;
that in the same group of insects this force varies in different
species; and that in the small species it is often of astounding
energy.</p>

<p>The muscles are enclosed in solid sheaths (so to speak), which
constitute the jointed limbs of insects, and the thickness of the
sides of these sheaths seems to decrease in ratio with the size.
No relation, therefore, exists between the stature of individuals
and the volume and strength of their muscles. A giant may
be weaker than a dwarf. Here is another mystery for science
to reveal!</p>


<p class="p1a">But we must take leave of our earwig. Its English name
is derived by some authorities from <em>ear</em>, and the old English
<em>wiega</em>, a worm or grub,&mdash;identical with the German <em>oberwurm</em>,
and based, of course, on the fiction which we have already
exploded.</p>

<p>Newman, however, suggests a somewhat different name, and,
consequently, a different etymology:<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>&mdash;"The shape of the
hind wings," he says, "when fully opened, is nearly that of
the human ear; and from this circumstance it seems highly
probable that the original name of this insect was <em>earwing</em>."
But we cannot agree with Mr Newman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>It remains to be added, that the female earwig sits upon
her eggs, and hatches them like a hen; and like a hen, too,
she gathers her young around her with evident affection.</p>

us in the shadows of the infinite, is the gift of genius. The first to
discern this point in astronomy, the illustrious Kepler thereby succeeded
in formulating those laws, or rather rules, by which the movements of the
stars are regulated. How did he succeed? How did he arrive at a goal so
much to be desired? By intelligence in full possession of itself. It was
by abstracting his thoughts from all systematic conceptions,&mdash;the
shackles of science; it was by defying the traditional authority which
had so long enslaved men's minds; it was by interrogating nature, which
leaves all liberty to her interrogator, that Kepler was able to deserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and win the glorious title of "legislator of the heavens,"&mdash;a title
which we must not, however, understand too literally; it bears witness
only to the power of intellect.</p>

<p>Let us attempt, at a modest distance, to proceed like Kepler; let us
make astronomy without troubling ourselves concerning astronomers. This
is the sole means of seizing the luminous point which should guide our

<p class="p1a">The movement, in virtue of which every star performs the
circuit of heaven in four-and-twenty hours, is incessantly reproduced
in a uniform and a constant manner. The acquisition of this first fact,

northern hemisphere (at the <em>spring equinox</em>), or into the southern (at
the <em>autumn equinox</em>),&mdash;is instantaneous. More than one way exists
of determining this moment exactly; but here we need not enter upon the
subject.</p>

<p>Is the interval of time occupied by the sun in travelling from the
spring to the autumn equinox equal to the interval which our luminary
requires to pass from the autumn equinox to the vernal?</p>

<p>A singular question, you reply. Who, indeed, would venture
to maintain that the number of days, hours, minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
seconds, was not exactly the same in the one case as in the
other?</p>

<p>Well, the period is <em>not</em> the same; and, therefore, merely to
propound <em>this</em> question was a masterpiece of genius. For no
ordinary intellectual audacity was needed to doubt the reality
of the supposed perfect circle which the sun apparently describes&mdash;according
to the recognised authorities&mdash;in its uniform
progress around the globe; that globe believed by all the early
astronomers to be imperturbably and everlastingly situated in
the centre of their thrice-sacred geometrical figure. This
dogma being accepted as infallible, there was every evidence
that the two intervals of time, which divided the astronomical
year into two moieties, would be of equal duration. It did
not occur to the mind of any one of the faithful that the sojourn
of the sun, in his circular and uniform movement, might
be longer or shorter in the northern than in the southern
hemisphere.</p>

<p>What, then, was the name of the audacious innovator who
ventured upon putting forth so revolutionary a suggestion?</p>

<p>It was Hipparchus. At least it was he who, confidently
relying upon his observations, was the first to affirm that the
sun remains longer in the northern than in the southern hemispheres;
or, more accurately speaking, that its passage from
the spring to the autumn equinox occupies 187 days, while
from the autumn to the spring equinox the duration of its
course is only 178 days 6 hours (nearly). The year of 365-1/4
days&mdash;that is, the Egyptian year, which was universally
adopted by the ancient astronomers&mdash;was thus discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
to be really divided into two unequal portions, although,
<em>theoretically</em>, the sun ought to occupy exactly the same space
of time in passing from the spring to the autumn, as from the
autumn to the spring equinox.</p>


<p class="p1a">The fact pointed out and attested by Hipparchus had an
influence which he never anticipated on the progress of science.
In opposition to all the systems previously designed by man,
it followed, in the first place, that the movement of the sun, in
relation to a mean movement, must sometimes be accelerated,
sometimes be retarded; that the solar arc described in a given
time would be greater in winter than in summer.</p>

<p>Astronomers who, trammelled by particular theories, were
unable and unwilling to accept of any new light, immediately
hastened to raise, as is invariably the case with those who
defend a bad cause, a subsidiary and damaging question.
They asked whether those inequalities of the sun's movement
were real, or only apparent; whether they were more than a
mere optical phenomenon, arising from the sun's position
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> to an observer placed on the earth's surface. And
they unhesitatingly pronounced in favour of the appearance,
and against the reality.</p>

<p>But man, says an old adage, is always punished after the
manner of his sin. Dogmatic and obstinate authority involved
our anti-revolutionary astronomers in fresh complications.
Such is the case, too, very frequently, in the domain
of theology!</p>

<p>Does the sun&mdash;the sun as each of us beholds him&mdash;ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
change his size? Does he ever shrink in his majestic proportions?
Is the magnitude of his broad golden disc ever lessened?</p>


<p class="p1a">Assuredly this new question, which was not less audacious
than its predecessor, did not come&mdash;there is sacrilege in the
thought&mdash;from the conservative areopagus of all ancient
doctrines; the learned areopagus, or supreme tribunal, which
had erected into a dogma the circular orbit and uniform movement
of the sun around the earth, the centre of the universe!
It could only have been suggested by some unworthy heterodoxical
disturber of men's minds,&mdash;his name, alas! has not
been handed down to us,&mdash;who had dared to look upon the
heavens, and learn from their bright and beautiful face, without
a master, the A B C of science. This "pestilent heretic"
had, probably, remarked one of the commonest phenomena
connected with the celestial bodies, which astronomers hitherto
had not deigned to notice.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, dear reader, you will have been more than
once impressed by the appearance of the solar orb, when
obscured in one of those mists so frequent towards the end of
autumn:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Such a day, in this sad season of the year, when the glory
of the woods is rapidly departing, and from the swollen streams
and dewy pastures the vapours ascend in a dense whirl of
clouds, is of frequent occurrence; and on such a day, the solar
sphere, as it struggles through the screening mists, seems like
the face of the moon at its full, when slightly veiled. Your eye
rests upon it without pain. And as observation sharpens your
mind, you put to yourself the natural question, Is not the sun
farther from the earth at this epoch when it affords us the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
least heat, than at that period of the year when its vivifying power is
greatest? I think it is obvious that, to the unexperienced, such a method
of explaining the cold of winter and the heat of summer by the variation
in the distance of our great solar luminary would naturally occur.</p>

<p>But the demon of certainty&mdash;an excellent demon, whatever the
orthodox may say&mdash;is present, to stimulate us all. You may have just
formed your theories, you may cite your traditional authorities, but
these will not satisfy our awakened curiosity. We ask for demonstrations,
for irrefragable proofs drawn from the Bible of Nature. We will listen to
no oracles but those which are confirmed by the voices of God's second
revelation.</p>

<p>Therefore, men required to be assured that the sun was really nearer
to us in summer than in winter. For this purpose, it was requisite to
make, at the beginning of summer, an observation analogous to that which
had been made at the beginning of winter, and afterwards to compare the
apparent magnitudes of the solar disc at these two opposite periods of
the year.</p>

<p>Behold us, then, at work. You are perfectly tranquil as to the
result; for you are persuaded beforehand that the sun <em>must</em> be
farther from us in the cold season than in the hot. You regard this as a
self-evident truth, like an axiom of Euclid's.</p>

<p>But Nature is a great magician; she contrives the most dramatic
surprises for the mind which takes the trouble to interrogate her in all
simplicity and without dogmatic pretensions.</p>

<p>What a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup-de-théâtre</i> it was for the observer who first
established experimentally that the apparent diameter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
sun is greater in winter than in summer&mdash;that we are <em>nearer</em> the
sun in the cold season, than in the hot!</p>


<p class="p1a">On more closely examining a result apparently so paradoxical,
man discovered that the angle which subtracts the sun, as
seen from the earth,&mdash;the <em>visual angle</em> which gives the sun's
apparent diameter,&mdash;varies necessarily throughout the year.
Thus, the semi-diameter, or radius, which on the 24th of June
equals 15' 45", will, a month later, have increased one second
(15' 46"); on the 2d of August will equal 15' 47"; on the 2d
September, 15' 53", and so on. We put the exact measurements
before the reader in a tabulated form:&mdash;</p>

<p>We do not trouble the reader with the fractions of a second,
which indicate the quantity of the apparent increase of the
radius from the end of June to the end of December, and
its apparent decrease from the beginning of January to the
end of June.</p>


<p class="p1a">A glance at the above figures shows that the mean of the
apparent diameters, all measured at the moment of the sun's
passing the meridian, is about half a degree, or 30'; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
that&mdash;which is sufficiently curious&mdash;720 of these mean suns,
set one against another, would be required to fill up the
contour of a great circle of the celestial sphere. Is it this
fact which suggested the idea of dividing the circle into
720/2 = 360&deg;?</p>


<p class="p1a">Simultaneously with the discovery of the variations of the
solar charioteer, it was ascertained that the moments of the
sun's passage of the meridian&mdash;moments which measure the
365 different positions occupied by the sun in the 365 days
of the year&mdash;are not separated by equal intervals, or that
equal intervals of time do not correspond to the equal angular
displacements,&mdash;in fine, that the maximum and minimum of
the sun's angular velocity coincide with the maximum and
minimum of its apparent diameter. Now, remember that
the extreme points where the sun experiences its maximum
and minimum angular displacement are named, according
to Ptolemæus, the former the <em>perigee</em>, the latter the <em>apogee</em>;
or, if we follow Copernicus, the former the <em>perihelion</em>, and
the latter the <em>aphelion</em>.</p>

<p>The aggregate of these facts was known to the ancients;
but the manner in which it was sought to explain them
merits notice as a specimen of blind attachment to a preconceived
system.</p>

<p>Ptolemæus, the organ of the dictatorial astronomy of
antiquity, declares, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex cathedrâ</i>, that "the inequalities of
the sun's movements are only apparent; that they are
simply the effects of the position and of the arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of the circles in which these movements are accomplished;
and that, in this <em>apparent disorder of the phenomena</em> (περί τὴν ὑπονουμένην τῶν
φαινομένων ἀταξίαν), nothing really occurs contrary
to their actual immobility (τῷ ὄντι πέφυκε
συμβαίνειν οὐδὲν ἀλλότριον αὐτῶν
τῆς ἀΐδιοτητος)."</p>

<p>Now, according to this dogmatic immutability, the straight
lines, or radii, which proceed from the revolving star to
the centre of the circle, would describe "equal angles in
equal times." This is exactly the contrary of the result
obtained, as we have seen, by careful observation.</p>

<p>But this difficulty no more embarrassed the great pontiff
of astronomy than a conscientious scruple would perplex
the author of a theological dogma. Listen to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The true cause of these apparent irregularities is explained
by two very simple hypotheses. Either the one or the other
would account for the phenomena. In fact, if we suppose
the movement to occur in a circle described around the
centre of the world, and in the plane of the ecliptic, so that
the point whence we are looking corresponds with this
centre, we must admit either that the planets make their
movements equal in non-concentric circles, or that, if these
circles are concentric, it is not simply in these circles that
they move, but in others, called <em>epicycles</em>, carried through
the concentric."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Examine Fig. 67. Here A B G D represent the ecliptic,
E its centre, and A E G its diameter; Z H T K is the
epicycle, in which the planet moves uniformly around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
centre A, while the epicycle uniformly traverses the circle A B G D. Now,
suppose that the star has arrived at H; it would appear to an observer at
E to be more advanced by the uniform movement of all the arc A H; if it
be at K, it would appear, on the contrary, to be less advanced by all the
arc A K. At Z the star would appear more distant, and at T, nearer than
if it were at A.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>&mdash;The Circle and the
Epicycle.</p></div>
</div>


<p class="p1a">To explain the other phenomena, such as the stations and
retrocessions of the planets, recourse was again had to the
epicycles or deferred eccentric circles. By multiplying these
it was possible to account for all the angular inequalities in
the movements of a planet. It is of importance to note this
point, in order to show how very dangerous it is to trust
absolutely to mathematics in our search after the truth; that
science which, by the certainty of its demonstrations, nourishes
our intellectual pride, and may, therefore, occasionally lull the
mind into a false security. The theory of epicycles, from a
mathematical point of view, was irreproachable, and it sufficiently
accounted for the facts which threatened to overthrow
the dogma of circular orbits and uniform planetary movement.</p>


<p class="p1a">But by degrees, as observations grew more accurate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
comprehensive, these and other theories, however fine in
appearance,&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">teres atque rotundus</i>,&mdash;gradually disappeared, if
fundamentally erroneous. By the invention of micrometers,
we were enabled to measure more exactly than had formerly
been possible the variations of diameter or the modifications
of distance, and afterwards to compare them with the changes
of velocity. From this comparison it results that the latter
are not greater than is compatible with the alterations of
distance indicated by the variations of diameter; in a word,
that the hypothesis of epicycles is decidedly insufficient to
account for all the inequalities detected by careful investigation.</p>


<p class="p1a">Kepler was the first to break the charm which had held
captive the mind of astronomers, including even Copernicus
and Tycho Brahé. Ptolemæus had considered the mean
positions of the stars to be real. Kepler, strong in his
researches, declared that they were but a factitious mode of
calculation by which the <em>true</em> positions might be ascertained;
that the mean movement is simply an artifice representing the
star's place, <em>if</em> no inequality existed; in fine, that we must
take the movements as they are in nature,&mdash;the true movements,
given by observation,&mdash;and not the mean movements,
deduced from an erroneous hypothesis.</p>

<p>This declaration of principles met, at the time, with the
hostility of all astronomers of any reputation, but it has
become the starting-point of the discovery of the laws on
which the whole edifice of astronomy reposes. Had Kepler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
however, been left to depend entirely on his own resources,
he might, perhaps, have never completed his task. A fortunate
circumstance brought him an unexpected ally. Tycho,
having taken refuge in Bohemia, sent for the young astronomer
(Kepler then was but twenty-nine years old), to assist
him in the composition of the "Rudolphine Tables."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>"This," says Kepler, "was a providential interposition.
I repaired to Bohemia early in the year 1600, in the hope of
learning the correction of the eccentricities of the planets.
Perceiving that Tycho made use of a mixed system (which
made Mercury and Venus revolve around the sun, and all
these planets, with their companions, around the earth), I
asked his permission to follow out my own ideas. It was the
will of Providence again, that we should occupy ourselves
with Mars. My whole attention, therefore, was directed to
this planet: and it is through the movements of Mars we
must obtain our insight into the secrets of astronomy, or
remain ignorant of them for ever (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex Martis motibus omnino
necesse est nos in cognitionem astronomiæ arcanorum venire aut ea
perpetuo nescire</i>)."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Why this preference given to Mars? In the first place,
because, among all the planets then known, it was Mars which,
in its movement round the sun, departed most from the circle;
next, its orbit approaches nearest to the earth's; the earth is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
very near to Mars when she passes between that planet and the
sun,&mdash;that is to say, when she is in <em>opposition</em>,
while she retires from it triple the distance when in
<em>conjunction</em>,&mdash;that is, when the sun is between her and
Mars. Hence arise certain variations of aspect, particularly adapted to
make manifest the form of the orbit, and the law of the real movement of
the "red planet, Mars." As for the other planets, as far as they were
then known, their orbits differ so little from the circle, that the
nature of the curve which they describe in reality would never have been
exactly recognised by any inexperienced star-gazer.</p>

<p>For these reasons Kepler regarded as providential the choice he had
been led to make of Mars at the outset of his astronomical career. Before
the close of 1601, Tycho died, bequeathing to his young fellow-worker a
treasury of observation. Thenceforth Kepler undertook to finish without
assistance the famous Rudolphine Tables. They cost him five-and-twenty
years of assiduous labour. Looking upon Tycho's observations, because of
their exactness, as "a gift from the Divine Goodness," he employed them,
in the first place, as a test of the old hypotheses of planetary orbits
and movements. Let us do our best to grasp the range and bearing of this
part of his work.</p>


<p class="p1a">In the system of Copernicus, which Kepler ardently adopted,
the earth revolves around the sun. Now, observation having
shown that the sun remains seven or eight days longer in the
northern than in the southern signs of the Zodiac, we must of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
necessity admit that the sun, instead of being situated in the
centre of the terrestrial orbit, occupies a point <em>outside</em> that
centre, in such a manner that the earth must sometimes be
nearer to, and sometimes farther from, the sun. The distance
by which it departs from the centre of its orbit, which Copernicus,
like the ancients, supposed to be circular, is called its
<em>eccentricity</em>.</p>

<p>Astronomers were long preoccupied with the idea of seeking in
this <em>eccentricity</em> a point where the movements should
appear equal. This point was the centre of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">equant</i>,&mdash;a
name given to the eccentric circle described from the point of equality
or from the centre of the mean movements.</p>

<p>Now, let us recall the principal condition of the problem which Kepler
had undertaken to solve. This condition required that the straight line
drawn from the centre of our globe to the centre of the sun,&mdash;in
a word, that the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vector radius</i>, as it is
called, should describe around the sun certain angles, whose variability
should agree with the results of observation.</p>

<p>Starting from this point, Kepler found that, for certain
positions of Mars (in the <em>aphelion</em> and <em>perihelion</em>, corresponding
to the <em>minimum</em> and <em>maximum</em> of velocity), the centre of the
orbit, always supposing it to be circular, divided into two equal
parts (or <em>bisected</em>) the total eccentricity: in other words, that it
exactly occupied the middle between the centre of the eccentric
and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">equant</i> of Ptolemæus; but it did not appear to
him necessary to bisect it in other positions, intermediate between
those of the aphelion and the perihelion. He established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
that the differences in longitude amounted to eight or nine
minutes. Now, observations so exact as those of Tycho were
altogether incompatible with such great error.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Therefore, the
geometrical hypothesis which gave these errors was false; the
orbit of Mars could not be a circle, and to save these eight or
nine minutes, furnished by observation but in disaccord with
theory, it would be needful to recommence all the calculations
of astronomy. This conclusion, not less legitimate than daring,
supplied Kepler with the first decisive step in the task he had
undertaken.</p>

<p>This is not the place to relate all the essays and miscarriages
through which this man of genius passed before finally completing
his discovery of the rules that bear his name. But
we may put before the reader the construction which led to
them.</p>

<p>On a sheet of paper let us mark down by a point (Fig. 68)
the place occupied by the earth in relation to the sun.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
From this point <em>o</em>, we draw a right line terminating at <em>a</em>, the
sun's noon-day position (for example, on the 1st of January);
the succeeding lines shall touch upon <em>a´ a´´</em>, which the sun
occupies successively after the same interval of time (twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
hours, or the exact duration of the earth's rotation on its
axis);&mdash;and let us continue after this mode until the sun has
accomplished, by its own proper movement from west to east, the whole
circuit of the heavens, traversing 360 degrees in the space of a year.
If we ascribe to the radius <em>o a</em> a certain length, corresponding to a
definite solar diameter, the lengths of all the others, corresponding to
the variations of the same diameter, will depend upon that of the first,
which, for facility of calculation, we suppose to be divided into one
thousand parts.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_322.jpg" width="289" height="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span>&mdash;Diagram for Kepler's Laws.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After having thus allotted to each straight line its approximate
length, let us join their extremities by a curve. What do
we see before us? A geometrical figure widely different from
a circle, for the diameters (<i>i.e.</i>, the straight lines passing through
the centre) are far from being equal. The figure is an ellipse.</p>

<p>If now we pass from the appearance to the reality, <i>o</i> will
be the sun, and <em>a a´ a´´</em>, <em>m m´</em> will indicate the terrestrial
orbit, or the points of the curve successively occupied by the
earth in movement. The moveable straight lines, free at one
extremity, and at the other attached to the centre of the sun,
are called the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vector heliocentric radii</i>. By the help of this
construction, you see that the point occupied by the sun is
beyond or without the centre; this eccentric point is the <em>focus</em>
of the ellipse, and the distance from this focus to the centre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
its <em>eccentricity</em>. The extremity of the major axis, the nearest to
the focus, is the <em>perihelion</em>, and its farthest extremity the <em>aphelion</em>.
The difference of the angles formed by the vector radii indicate
the inequality of the movements: to the greatest angle,
the perihelion, corresponds the <em>maximum</em> of velocity (<em>a a´ a´´</em>),
just as to the smallest, or aphelion, corresponds the <em>minimum</em>
(<em>m m´</em>); the other angles mark the velocities intermediary
between these two extremes. We have thus before us a series
of triangles with their apices at the focus of the ellipse, and their
bases on the contour of the curve.</p>

<p>But these latter are not sufficient for the mind, whose principal
function lies in seeking unity among the variety of
phenomena.</p>

<p>In what way are the variations of distance connected with
the variations of velocity? What is the simplest expression of
their relationship? These are questions which naturally presented
themselves to Kepler's inquiring intellect. By dint of
immeasurable patience, and recommencing more than once
the same toil, this great astronomer discovered that the variable
arc traversed by the earth (or, in appearance, the sun), in
four-and-twenty hours, multiplied by one half the corresponding
vector radius, is a constant quantity: is the product which,
as elementary geometry teaches, gives the surface of a triangle.
And, in fact, look at the matter carefully: the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vector radii</i>
form triangles whose base is the arc traversed in the same
interval of time, and whose apices rest upon the centre of
the sun (or, in appearance, the observer, or the centre of the
earth).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>To fix these ideas thoroughly in our minds,&mdash;and a superficial
knowledge is worse than useless,&mdash;let us imagine to ourselves
a man holding horizontally extended a tube of a certain
length, capable, like a telescope, of being lengthened or shortened
at pleasure; and let us fancy him pivoting upon himself,
in such a manner that he sweeps, every minute, exactly the
same area or same quantity of surface, while varying perpetually
the swiftness of movement and the length of the
tube; this "ideal man" will have solved the problem whose
solution is inscribed, in ineffaceable letters, on the machinery
of our globe; he will describe around him an ellipse, of which
he himself occupies one of the foci.</p>


<p class="p1a">By this method of investigation and deduction, Kepler succeeded
in breaking up the traditionary authority of the circle
and of uniform movement. He broke it up for ever by two of
his celebrated laws, which may be rendered in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1st, <em>The orbit of the earth, as well as the curves described by
the other planets, are ellipses, one of whose foci is represented
by the sun</em>;</p>

<p>2d, <em>The heliocentric vector radius of a planet describes around
the sun areas equal with the times; or, in other words, the
surfaces described by the vector radii, in equal times, are
also equal.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The ancients had looked for equality in the movements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
planets traversing the circumferences of circles: they were
mistaken. It is true this equality exists; only, not where they
supposed. If they had sought it in the surfaces described by
the vector radii, they would have anticipated Kepler's discovery
of the laws which govern our world.</p>

<p>But their astronomical dogmas prevented them from seeing
the path which led to this great discovery.</p>

<p>Hence we may conclude that Dogma is an evil thing.</p>

<span class="hiddena">O</span><span class="smcap">f</span> all the strata composing our planetary mass, the
most important, so far as man is concerned, is,
at the same time, the most superficial; for it is
here that all the phenomena of life transpire. Our
vegetable earth is the great laboratory in which are
prepared all the solid, liquid, and gaseous aliments
necessary for the nourishment of animal life. It is on
the surface of the globe that men play their various
parts. And why? Can it be for no other purpose than
to modify, in some degree, its aspect, that they occupy
the terrestrial surface? One would be tempted to think
so on consulting what these majestic <em>bimanes</em> pompously
designate their "Universal History." Regions formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
blooming with fertility,&mdash;gay with gardens, and orchards,
and meadows,&mdash;musical with brooks, and glorious with harvest,&mdash;are
now uncultivated and barren. Monuments which
seemed adapted to defy the winds and the rains, and the
corroding touch of the years, lie shattered in ruins; and with
them the once populous cities and the once mighty empires of
which they were the pride. The jackal howls among the
broken columns of Tadmor; the sand-drifts have accumulated
above the splendour of Memphis and Thebes. With their
stones other monuments are raised, other cities are embellished,
and other empires, which, in their turn, undergo the
same unalterable fate: a perpetual relation of human forms,
in every respect comparable with that which transpires in the
bosom of the prolific earth, our common mother and nurse.</p>

<p>But why do men wander so far from the straight way? Why
do they their best to ensure each other's unhappiness? They
seem, alas! ignorant of the tendency of their actions, while
attaching themselves to things transitory, and despising things
imperishable. These, indeed, they would utterly ignore; they
would live, like the brutes, unconscious of their destiny, if, at
the bottom of their indestructible conscience, there did not
prevail a glimmer of light, though more or less eclipsed, if
they did not all feel themselves attracted, if they did not all
irresistibly gravitate, some more quickly, others more slowly,
towards the sun of eternal truth and justice. Instead of
moving with sidelong sinuous pace, instead of taking ninety-nine
steps backward for every one hundred taken in advance,
they would all march onward in the way of progress; were it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
not that they pass their time in clipping their own wings; were
it not that, to bend their heads the better&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Veluti pecora ventri
obedientia</i>&mdash;they check the aspiring flight of that thought which
would soar beyond the present; in a word, were it not that
they lay a sacrilegious hand&mdash;unfortunate wretches!&mdash;on that
which God Himself has respected in His creature&mdash;Liberty!
The doubt which perplexes us as to the great problem of our
destiny,&mdash;the doubt which allows so much latitude to the
workings of our conscience,&mdash;does it not indicate the path
we ought to follow? Should not men regard their freedom
with peculiar reverence, when the Divinity they invoke has
mercifully refrained from fettering it? Creatures of a day,
who live as if you would never die! the contradictions and the
miseries of which you so incessantly complain, are your own
work. Help, help yourselves, by the development of your
faculties, by the cultivation of your heart and mind, for herein
you shall see the law and the prophets. Barren lip-service is
nothing better than blasphemy!</p>


<p class="p1a">But let us return to the ground which we tread, and where
our life-companions are the animals and the plants.</p>


<p class="p1a">The uppermost stratum of our globe undergoes the direct
action of the light and heat of the all-vivifying "orb of day."
This action, very unequal in its effects, and most important to
understand, has scarcely been touched as yet by scientific
research. Our geologists, having been more busily engaged
with the inside than the outside of the earth, have broached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
certain plausible theories&mdash;for the most part of a very dubious
character&mdash;respecting the central fire, Plutonism and Neptunism,
the stratification of the planets, the formation of mountains,
valleys, and basins. Our mineralogists, thinking far
less of the chemical molecular constitution of the different
formations than of their crystalline constitution, have minutely
studied the physical qualities and geometrical forms of the
integral parts of the rocks; but neither have condescended to
direct their inquiries to the layer of soil trodden underneath
their feet. Yet this very layer of arable earth, to which all
bodies must return after death what they have taken from it
during life,&mdash;this much despised <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">humus</i>, furnishes all our agricultural
products, the very foundation and support of our
material existence.</p>

<p>To touch industrial occupations&mdash;to meddle with trade,
commerce, or agriculture&mdash;is unworthy of Science! Such is
the silly cry of the many distinguished savants who pride
themselves on what they call their "freedom from selfish considerations."</p>

<p>Be it so; but then you ought surely to be consistent, and
never regard science as a profession or a bread-winner.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">On the Chemical Action of Light.</span></p>

<p>It is no easy study to investigate the modifications and
chemical effects which the terrestrial surface is capable of
receiving or undergoing, either from the direct rays of the sun,
or from diffused light. It requires new methods of inquiry,&mdash;methods
frequently of extreme delicacy, as the labours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Bunsen and Roscoe, of Kirchhofer and Tyndall, have abundantly
demonstrated. Let us here confine ourselves to establishing
the fact that the chemical action of light varies according
to the geological constitution of the soil,&mdash;according to the
diurnal and annual obliquity of the solar rays,&mdash;according to the
hours of the day,&mdash;according to the latitudes and seasons. The
maximum of effects is manifested about the times of the solstices.</p>

<p>For the better co-ordination of these phenomena, might
we not, as has been done in regard to the distribution of
heat over the terrestrial surface,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> link together by lines the
points of equality? We should thus create an aggregate of
<em>iso-photo-chemical</em> lines,&mdash;diurnal, mensual, and annual,&mdash;of
incontestible utility for the progress of general physics and
meteorology, which are still in their infancy.</p>

<p>But to realise this magnificent programme, the union and
agreement is necessary of scientific men in every region of
the globe; an ideal, therefore, as yet, is very far from being
attained.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Action of Heat.</span></p>

<p>The earth is subject to the influence of two different
sources of heat. One, like the arterial blood, strikes from
the centre to the circumference: this internal heat it is
which has been stored up since the unknown epoch when
our globe was nothing more than an incandescent nucleus,
surrounded by condensable vapours. The other, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
venous blood, flows from the circumference towards the
centre: this is the solar heat which the earth continues to
receive through its crust.</p>

<p>The first of these sources lies beyond the domain of
experiment. It has been the object of numerous hypotheses
and diverse speculations, with which we shall not here concern
ourselves. The second source is alone accessible to
our investigations, and yet the network of <em>isothermal lines</em> is
scarcely defined.</p>

<p>Since the year 1817, when Alexander von Humboldt
conceived the felicitous idea of representing by lines the
same mean temperatures enjoyed, in a given space of time,
by the different regions of the globe, researches of this
nature have very considerably multiplied. But these researches&mdash;do
not forget&mdash;refer rather to the temperature
of the atmosphere than to the heating of the inferior stratum
of that gaseous ocean whose bed or foundation is the terrestrial
crust. And it is the penetration of the latter by the
sun's calorific rays which we would especially desire to understand.
Here, then, a sufficient margin is left for our curiosity.</p>

<p>"If the king, my father, does not rest from his conquests,"
cried Alexander of Macedon, while still a child,
"he will leave me nothing to do when I shall have reached
manhood." To such a complaint, be you sure, dear reader,
that the conquests made by science will never give rise.
Every step in advance is but a step into the infinite: what
we have done only shows us the boundless extent of what
we have to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>It is this reflection which must always teach humility to
the scientific student, even while he rejoices in the achievements
of human patience and genius. He will not despair
for he knows that great victories have been won: he will
not grow arrogant, for he knows that he is still on the
threshold of eternal truth. As Sir J. Herschel has justly
said:&mdash;"He who has seen obscurities, which appeared impenetrable,
in physical and mathematical science, suddenly
dispelled, and the most barren and unpromising fields of
inquiry converted, as if by inspiration, into rich and inexhaustible
springs of knowledge and power, on a simple
change of our point of view, or by merely bringing them
to bear on some principle which it never occurred before
to try, will surely be the very last to acquiesce in any dispiriting
prospects of either the present or the future destinies of
mankind; while, on the other hand, the boundless views of
intellectual and moral, as well as material relations, which
open to him on all hands in the course of these pursuits,&mdash;the
knowledge of the trivial place he occupies in the scale
of creation, and the sense continually pressed upon him of
his own weakness and incapacity to suspend or modify the
slightest movement of the vast machinery he sees in action
around him, must effectually convince him that humility of
pretension, no less than confidence of hope, is what best
becomes his character."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The temperature of the terrestrial surface perpetually varies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
under the influence of local as well as general causes. Had
this fact been known to the philosophers of antiquity, they
would have taken advantage of it to liken the earth to an
animal whose skin is more or less sensible of heat, not only
according to the difference of the seasons, but according to
the different hours of the day.</p>

<p>The diurnal thermometrical variations are those which
penetrate the least profoundly into the interior of the soil.
At a depth of about five feet they cease to be perceptible.
The maxima and minima of the year, however, can be
detected at a sufficiently considerable depth. The limit
descends as low as 80 to 100 feet. Below 100 feet, the
terrestrial stratum is found invariable,&mdash;that is, inaccessible
to the thermometrical changes of the atmosphere. It is
remarkable that the temperature of this stratum differs but
little from the mean annual temperature of the air, which, in
the latitude of London, is 49&deg;.</p>


<p class="p1a">The maxima and minima of the yearly heat are propagated
very slowly in the earth, and their difference gradually becomes
less and less. Thermometers buried 26 feet deep
in the ground, mark, in our latitudes, the maximum of temperature
only on the 10th of December, and the minimum
on the 15th of June. But there are certain elements which
we must take into account. Thus, the depth of the invariable
thermometrical curve depends both on the latitude of
the place, on the conductibility of the strata, and the difference
between the highest and lowest temperature of the year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
The less this difference, the more nearly does the invariable
stratum approach the surface. Here we have the reason
why, in the intertropical torrid zone, where the temperature
scarcely varies above two or three degrees in the whole year,
the invariable curve is not found more than forty centimetres
beneath the surface.</p>


<p class="p1a">In the temperate zone, lying between the torrid and the
frigid zones, the same phenomena assume, apparently, a more
complex character; the isogeothermal lines inflect as diversely
as the isothermal, and the former are far from running parallel
with the latter. And this is easily understood, even without
any experiment, for there is no relation between the ever-varied
composition of the terrestrial strata, and the much
more uniform composition of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>In the frigid zone, the soil remains constantly frozen for
an insignificant depth, whatever may be the temperature of
the encircling atmosphere. In some regions a stratum
of ice and snow eternally reposes on the surface of the
soil.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the observations, which require to be undertaken
on an uniform plan and under well-weighed conditions,
at various points over the whole globe, are as yet far too
few to assist us in defining any general currents of heat or
cold, whether variable or constant, as prevailing in the lower
strata of the gaseous ocean of our planet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Arable Land.</span></p>

<p>A more useful picture than that of the isogeothermal lines
would be one of all the arable land covering the continents of
the Old World and the New,&mdash;indicating the composition of
this nutritive earth, the nature of the soil on which it reposes,
as well as the various kinds of cultivation appropriate in
different climates. Here is a work to be achieved,&mdash;a work
which would benefit the whole human race,&mdash;a work differing
vastly from the conquests and achievements of too many of
those "heroes" the world delights to honour.</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this immense task, of which, as yet, not even the outlines
have been sketched, particular attention would require
to be paid to the <em>subsoil</em>; for upon this the success of all
cultivation literally depends.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_335.jpg" width="350" height="113" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>&mdash;<i>a</i>, Humus, or stratum of arable earth,&mdash;the
horizontal line shows the depth reached by the
labourer; <i>b</i>, subsoil; <i>c</i>, subsoil; <i>d</i>, arable earth;
<i>e</i>, humus in an inclined stratum; <i>f</i>, humus
mixed with subsoil.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Arable land is the most superficial stratum of the cultivable
terrestrial crust; it is this which the plough turns up and subdues; it
is this which, properly manured, and enriched by the decomposition of
organic matter, furnishes to vegetables their principal nourishment.
As it varies in thickness, it necessarily presents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
one or other of the following circumstances:&mdash;1st, The labourer,
penetrating the entire stratum of arable earth (Fig. 69, <i>a</i>), will
strike down to the subsoil (Fig. 69, <i>b</i>); or, 2d, he will not traverse
the entire stratum (Fig. 69, <i>c</i>); or, 3d, after having traversed
the entire depth of the humus, he will reach a portion of
the subsoil (Fig. 69, <i>d</i>); or, 4th, after having gone through both
humus and subsoil, he will discover another layer of arable earth,
which may be either pure humus, in a thick inclined stratum
(Fig. 69, <i>e</i>), or humus mixed with the débris of the subsoil.</p>

<p>As for the subsoil, it may, by its composition, completely
modify, stimulate, or delay the action of the vegetable mould,
however rich this may be in assimilating principles. Thus,
where the subsoil is argillaceous, the pluvial waters are
arrested by it as by a bed of impervious cement, and render
the ground too damp and cold to yield abundant harvests.
In such a case subsoil-drainage is the best remedy. But if
the earth be porous, the moisture gradually percolates through
its various layers, fertilising and warming, communicating to
the plants the needful humidity, and assisting in the production
of that most glorious of all the scenes of cultivated nature&mdash;a
corn-field thickly ripe with golden grain. In the poet's
"Palace of Art" no finer picture can be seen than this:</p>

<p>Without having recourse to chemical analysis, which is within
the reach of a very limited number of persons, <em>clayey</em> soils
may be distinguished by the vegetable species that most commonly
flourish in them: as&mdash;</p>

<p>After these different soils have been brought under cultivation,
the characteristic species, which we have just enumerated,
disappear, and are replaced by other plants, which grow, to all
appearance, spontaneously, under the name of <em>weeds</em>; but, in
reality, spring from germs or seeds too frequently mixed up
with the different manures, or spread abroad by the agency of
birds or the wind.</p>

<p>In reference to this latter consideration, the diffusion of
plants, we shall transcribe an interesting passage from Balfour's
excellent "Manual of Botany."</p>

<p>"Some plants," he remarks, "are disseminated generally over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
the globe, while others are confined within narrow limits.
Some of the common weeds in Britain, such as chickweed,
shepherd's purse, and groundsel, are found at the southern extremity
of South America. <em>Laura minor</em> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">trisulca</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Convolvulus
sepium</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Phragmites communis</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cedium Mariscus</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Scirpus
lacustris</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Juncus effusus</i>, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Solanum nigrum</i>, are said to be
common to Great Britain and New Holland. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nasturtium
officinale</i>, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Samolus Valerandi</i> are very extensively diffused,
and they may be reckoned true cosmopolites. They are both
natives of Europe, and they occur, the former near Rio Janeiro,
the latter at St Vincent. <em>The lower the degree of development,
the greater seems to be the range.</em> Some cryptogamic plants, as
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Lecanora subfusca</i>, are found all over the globe.</p>

<p>"Man has been instrumental in widely distributing culinary
vegetables, such as the potato, and the cereal grains, as well as
many other plants useful for food and manufacture. Corn
plants, such as barley, oats, rye, wheat, spelt, rice, maize, and
millet, are so generally cultivated over the globe, that almost
all trace is lost of their native country. They can arrive at
perfection in a great variety of circumstances, and they have
thus probably a wider geographical range than any other kind
of plants.</p>

<p>"As regards these plants, the globe may be divided into <em>five</em>
grand regions&mdash;the region of <em>rice</em>, which may be said to support
the greatest number of the human race; the region of <em>maize</em>;
of <em>wheat</em>; of <em>rye</em>; and lastly, of <em>barley</em> and <em>oats</em>. The first
three are the most extensive, and maize has the greatest range
of temperature.</p>

India, Arabia, Egypt, the Canary Islands, &amp;c. Wheat can be reared
wherever the mean temperature of the whole year is not under 37&deg; or
39&deg; F., and the mean summer heat, for a period of at least three or
four months, is above 55&deg;. It succeeds best on the limits of the
sub-tropical region. In the Scandinavian peninsula, the cultivation
of barley extends to 70&deg; N. latitude, rye to 67&deg;, and oats to
65&deg;. The cultivation of rice prevails in Eastern and Southern Asia,
and it is a common article of subsistence in various countries bordering
on the Mediterranean. Maize succeeds best in the hottest and dampest
parts of tropical climates. It may be reared as far as 40&deg; N. and S.
latitude on the American continent, on the western side; while in Europe
it can grow even to 50&deg; or 52&deg; of latitude. It is now cultivated
in all regions in the tropical and temperate zones which are colonised by
Europeans. Millet of different kinds is met with in the hottest parts of
Africa, in the South of Europe, in Asia Minor, and in the East Indies."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Mushrooms or Agarics</span> (<em>Order</em> <span class="smcap">Fungi</span>).</p>

<p>Every year&mdash;principally in autumn&mdash;we are startled
by hearing or reading of cases of poisoning by mushrooms. Erudite
connoisseurs, however, who have profited by Dr Badham's book on "Esculent
Fungi," do not suffer themselves to be intimidated by these sad
narratives, though, unfortunately, they are frequently too well founded;
because they know how to distinguish the good from the ill, the true from
the false, the edible from the poisonous mushroom. But this security
ought not to embolden the inexperienced amateur in risking his life for
the sake of a delicacy. It is true, nevertheless, that we frequently see
men's lives exposed for something less.</p>

<p>"Look, what a splendid mushroom I have discovered!" a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
lady said to me, the other day; a lady who knew something of flowers, but
nothing of <em>cryptogams</em>. "Take care!" I replied, taking from her hand the
supposed prize; "this is the false mushroom; and would suffice, if served
up at your table, to poison yourself and all your guests."</p>

<p>I ought here to observe that my friend had narrowly escaped death two
years before, through regaling herself with a dish of mushrooms of very
dubious character. Among the symptoms which she experienced, and which
she described with medical exactness, she particularly dwelt upon the
cold sweats, accompanied by a sentiment of undefinable terror, which
is nothing else than the dread of death: it was the special symptom of
poisoning with an unwholesome fungus.</p>

<p>Let us endeavour to make ourselves better acquainted with this
formidable enemy of epicures. You will have no difficulty in finding
it in any warm, close season, but especially in spring and autumn. The
toadstool thrives indifferently in the shade of all the forest trees,
but seems to prefer the oak and birch to the pine and fir. A patch of
soft greensward, at the foot of an old oak, and in the neighbourhood of
a "brawling stream" or "tranquil pool," will generally be covered with
fungi of this description. The numerous synonyms attaching to it show how
greatly it has exercised the <em>classifying spirit</em> of our naturalists.
Some call it <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agaricus muscarius</i>, as if we should say "kill-fly
mushroom;" others, changing only the specific designation, designate it
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agaricus pseudo-aurantiacus</i>,&mdash;which signifies, literally, "false
orange," in allusion to the beautiful yellow colour of the <em>true</em>
aurantiacus. What is certain is, that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
mushroom, which can kill men as well as flies, belongs to the
genus <em>Agaric</em>, so numerous in species that it can be formed into
a family, that of the <em>Agariceæ</em>. The Agarics, of which the
esculent mushroom (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agaricus edulis</i>) represents the type, are
easily recognised by their more or less fleshy <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pileus</i>, or cap,
garnished underneath with <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lamellæ</i>, or gills, which radiate from
the centre to the circumference, when the pedicel is in the
centre.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_344.jpg" width="500" height="568" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>&mdash;"At the foot of an old oak."</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>But some cryptogamists are unwilling to recognise the <em>orange
mushrooms</em> (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">les oronges</i>), whether true
or false, as Agarics. They place them in a separate genus, the genus
<em>Amanita</em>, though without informing us where they found the
name. Meanwhile, they justify the formation of the new genus by the
presence of the white swelling, the <em>volva</em>, or wrapper, of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mycelium</i>, or spawn, which entirely covers
both the true and the false mushroom on its emergence from the earth.
Each, then, is an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Amanita</i>. But now remark
their specific difference. The true mushroom, as it develops, ruptures
its ovoid wrapper, or volva, leaving the remains entirely at the base
of the pedicel; while, in the false mushroom, the débris of the volva
are formed, not only at the base of the pedicel, as in the real Agaric,
but even upon the red surface of the pileus itself: these are the white
irregular warts characteristic of the Amanita, but wholly wanting
in the Agaricus. Thus, there are two Amanitas: the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Amanita muscaria</i>,
or "fly agaric," and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Amanita aurantiaca</i>,
or, as the English botanists call it, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agaricus
Cæsareus</i>, the imperial mushroom.</p>

<p>This fanciful "study" in nomenclature has the advantage of initiating
us into the most essential distinctive characters of the two species in
question. However, a few additional details are necessary to complete our
history.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Fly Agaric, or Amanita muscaria.</span></p>

<p>The species seems to have been expressly created to teach
our gourmands the necessity of vigilance; that before enjoying
a dainty they must first learn to distinguish, under penalty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
death, the poisonous fungus from that which safely and pleasantly tickles
the palate. The warning is useful, moreover, as showing that even
sensualists are not wholly exempt from the law of work.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/i_346.jpg" width="257" height="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span>&mdash;The <em>Amanita
Muscaria</em>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The <em>Amanita</em>, like most falsehoods, is pleasant to the sight. Its
round pileus, of a beautiful orange-red colour, spotted with white warts,
and lined with white gills, seems to invite your attention. (Fig. 73.)
Strike it down with your stick; the lamellæ or gills underneath resemble
the white leaves of a book. Its graceful stalk, ornamented on the upper
part by a well-designed necklet, is bulbous in its lower portion; its
flesh is dazzlingly white; in short, its entire appearance is attractive.
Yet it is a traitor! You little know the depth of its wickedness. Mix a
few shreds of its white flesh with a little milk; every fly which drinks
of the mixture will, in a few seconds, fall dead, their swollen abdomen
bearing testimony to the effect of the poison. And in many districts of
Germany, particularly in Thuringia, the peasants make use of it to rid
themselves of the swarms of flies which, towards the close of summer,
infest their habitations. It is thus that man may frequently turn to his
advantage those objects of nature which, at the first glance, appear
injurious rather than useful.</p>

<p>Various experiments have been essayed to test the intoxicating
influence of our <em>Amanita</em>. Bulliard, author of the
"Histoire des Champignons de France," made two cats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
partake of it. Six hours afterwards, these animals, who are
so tenacious of life, were dead.</p>

<p>Haller, in his "Histoire des Plantes Vénéneuses de la
Suisse," says that "the <em>Agaricus muscarius</em> (<em>Amanita
muscaria</em>) cannot be eaten with impunity, six Lithuanians having died
of it; and in Kamtschatka it has been known to excite deadly attacks
of delirium, accompanied by so deep a despondency, that those who have
eaten of it would fain fling themselves into the fire, or fall upon their
knives or daggers." This, however, we take to be an exaggeration. The
truth is, that in Kamtschatka it is used to produce intoxication; and
such is its strength, it imparts an intoxicating property to the urine of
those who swallow it. When the fungus itself is not at hand, the would-be
drunkard frequently resorts to this nauseous potion.</p>

<p>The flesh of the <em>Amanita</em> is not yellow. Yet Vicat speaks
of poisonings produced by the <em>Yellow Amanita</em>. "I had much
difficulty," says this physician, "in saving two families of Lausanne,
poisoned through eating a very small quantity of mushrooms, which the
father in the one case, and the mother in the other, had mistaken for
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agarici Cæsarei</i>, though they were both esteemed
great connoisseurs, and especially in this species; nor had they been
once deceived for upwards of thirty years, until they indulged themselves
in this delicious but deceitful dish."</p>

<p>These poisonings could have been occasioned only by the <em>Amanita</em>.
Some varieties exist, in which the under surface of the pileus is yellow,
but the flesh is white. To one of these varieties Vicat's anecdote
probably refers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Amanita formosa</i> of Persoon has pedicel, pileus,
and warts of the pileus, of a citron yellow. It is but a variety
of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Amanita muscaria</i>.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Amanita umbrina</i> of the same botanist (the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agaricus
pantherinus</i> of De Candolle) has an olive-coloured pileus; its
surface, like that of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Amanita muscaria</i>, is covered with white
scales.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Amanita solitarius</i> is distinguished by the size of its
umbilical cap,&mdash;sometimes depressed in the centre,&mdash;which is
furnished with a great number of white or pale brown scales; when fully
developed, it measures from thirty to forty centimetres in diameter.
The pedicel is bulbous, with a membranous ring, white as snow, clasped
around it; at the base it is clothed in pellicles, the remains of its
scaly volva. The flesh is firm, thick, and white. You rarely meet with
more than two or three individuals in the same locality; hence its name
of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">solitarius</i>. Bulliard speaks of the flesh as good to eat, when cooked
on a gridiron, and seasoned with fresh butter, salt, and pepper. It is
possible. But as it is so easily confused with the poisonous species,
the author of the "Histoire des Champignons" would have done better to
prohibit its consumption, whether eatable or not.</p>

<p>We may now turn to the method adopted by Dr Vicat to save the lives
of the two families at Lausanne, who, as we have seen, were poisoned by
partaking of the <em>Amanita</em>:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p1a">I dissolved, he says, six grains of tartar emetic in a litre of
water, and from time to time administered a spoonful to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
patients; moreover, I made them swallow floods of warm water, sweetened
with a little honey,&mdash;that is, a large tea-spoonful of honey to a
cupful of water.</p>

<p>I had much difficulty to get one of the sufferers, who was sixty years
old, to swallow the first few spoonfuls. He was plunged into a lethargic
insensibility differing in no respect from complete apoplexy; his teeth
were closely set. Those whom I had ordered to administer the mixture had
given it up, after several useless attempts; and in all probability the
old man would have sunk, had I not had the patience to hold, for some
hours, against his teeth the back of the blade of a small silver knife,
so as to profit by the few moments when the teeth were a little less
firmly clenched. I used some force to make the blade act as a wedge, and
after a while opened up a passage to the handle, which, serving as a
lever, forced the jaws sufficiently apart to admit the introduction of a
spoonful of the emetic. It was not, however, until fully two hours had
passed that the patient, having undoubtedly swallowed the necessary dose,
began to vomit, with strenuous efforts and frightful cries. This was at
midnight. Four in the morning arrived before, after numerous alternations
of vomiting and profound lethargy, he began to speak, and then like a
man in delirium. After the first vomit, which was inconsiderable, the
convulsions of his whole body were so very violent as to require four men
to hold him, while I continued to make use of my knife as at first. Nor
did I desist until I was satisfied that his stomach had been sufficiently
cleansed. After this, I applied two strong blisters to the back of his legs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
As these acted, the purging subsided, and at the end of twenty-four hours
it had passed away entirely, the invalid finding himself as well as could
be expected after sustaining so severe a shock. The other patients, who
were not in so much danger, experienced twitchings and tremblings in
the face, which quite disfigured them; the brain seemed a blank; though
awake, they felt as in a dream, and their visions were most frightful.</p>

<p>It is evident, from these particulars, that mushroom-poisoning
specially affects the encephalic nervous system, and that the best
remedies are emetics and antispasmodics. In our present ignorance of what
are the poisonous principles in the <em>Amanita</em>, we can adopt no other
method than a chemical neutralisation.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Agaricus Cæsareus, or Imperial Mushroom.</span></p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>&mdash;The Imperial
Mushroom.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In this mushroom, for which, as we have seen, the <em>Amanita</em>
is too frequently mistaken, the inside as well as the outside is
yellow; the upper surface of the pileus, which is equally free
from scales and warts, is, however, of a reddish yellow, like
that of an orange (whence the popular French name, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la vrai
oronge</i>); all the other parts are of a beautiful citron hue. This
agaric exhales an agreeable odour, combined apparently of the
scent of the vanilla and the truffle. It decomposes rapidly, and
when in a state of advanced putridity, the fragrance I speak of
is succeeded by&mdash;well, by a fearful stench! When young, and
still completely covered with its wrapper or <em>volva</em> (this, in the
<em>Amanita</em>, is imperfect), it is very like a hen's egg which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
been partly buried in the ground so as to expose only the
larger end. It seems partial to solitude; more than four or
five are seldom found in the same locality. Moreover, in
autumn it affects the same habitats as the <em>Amanita</em>,&mdash;which
is unfortunate.</p>

<p>It would seem that our imperial mushroom was specially appreciated by
the ancients, and it is said that Nero pronounced it a dish fit for the
gods. In this circumstance originated the scientific name which has now
become popular, and which was first applied to it by the cryptogamist
Fries, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agaricus Cæsareus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Boletus</i> of Pliny appears to have been our Agaricus, and
not one of our <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Boleti</i>, which are easily recognised by the
numerous tubercular projections covering the under part of
the pileus. In proof of this I would point out that the
Roman naturalist, after speaking of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Boleti</i> as genuine
delicacies, immediately inveighs against them as dangerously
poisonous. He relates that it was with one of these, or rather
with one of the false mushrooms so easily mistaken for the
true, that Agrippina poisoned the Emperor Claudius, to secure
the imperial crown for her son Nero.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The virtues of the mushrooms have been sung by Juvenal
and Martial. The latter accurately distinguishes the true
from the false, when reproaching Cæcilianus with his gluttony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>

<p>I will not do my readers the injustice to suppose that they are
unacquainted with the writings of our greatest English poetess, Elizabeth
Barrett Browning. They will not fail to have been attracted by the
prodigal genius, the superabundant power, the exquisite imagery, the
profound spirit of tenderness, the high, pure thoughts, which render
almost every page such delightful reading. Successful as she was,
however, in giving expression to the most subtle emotions and the
intensest feeling, I think she was even happier in her descriptions of
scenery. These are invariably aglow with life and colour, and have all
the fidelity of Creswick with the imaginative insight of Turner. Turning

<p>As I read this fine passage, the thought occurred to me,
how many thousands there are who, in such a scene as it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
vividly depicts, would see no beauty whatever, whose heart would not
respond to it, whose sympathies would not be aroused by all its variety
of outline and all its rich magnificence of colour! Yet not in so
wide a landscape alone, but in the smallest nook,&mdash;in the little
clump of elms by the side of the stream, in yonder grassy knoll rising
straight up from the old churchyard, in the quiet angle of the green
pasture-meadows,&mdash;there is a whole world of wonder and beauty for
him who has eyes to see and a heart to feel! Look at the flowery bank
which runs along the side of an English lane. Is it not crowded with
objects of the rarest and purest interest? Count the many varieties
of grasses which clothe it so abundantly, count the many species of
flowers and herbs which adorn it with a grace beyond all human skill, and
acknowledge that in itself it might supply the inquirer with matter for
years of study and meditation.</p>

<p>Pursuing this train of thought, I was led to think of the number
of genera and species into which the plant world is divided,&mdash;a
remarkable proof, not only of the power and wisdom, but of the goodness
of the Creator, of His desire to furnish man with inexhaustible sources
of pleasure and entertainment; and finally, to put to myself the
question, How many vegetable species exist over the whole surface of the
globe? If this corner of a leafy English lane is so rich in variety, what
must be the case with "the wide, wide world?"</p>

<p>I was now brought to see that a question so difficult could,
like so many others, be usefully approached only by its
<em>inferior limit</em>; in other words, that in the actual condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
botanical science, we can but affirm the number which certainly <em>exceeds</em>
the sum of the vegetable species scattered over the surface of our earth.
To determine this total with mathematical accuracy, we should need to
have explored the terrestrial crust, liquid and solid, land and water,
from the bed of ocean to the line of perpetual snow, and from the equator
to the poles. And as yet we are very far from having obtained so complete
a possession of the planet which has been assigned as a dwelling-place to
our poor humanity,&mdash;alas, more presumptuous than powerful!</p>


<p class="p1a">The number of plants mentioned by Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and
Pliny, whom we take to be the representatives of ancient botany, does not
exceed five hundred species. How very few, compared with the presumable
total! The Middle Ages added scarcely anything to the botanical
researches of antiquity. It is only since the discovery of America
that we have seen the domain of Flora extending itself in unexpected
proportions. But we must come down to the epoch of Linnæus (the middle of
the eighteenth century) before we can obtain an accurate list of species,
scientifically classified. Murray's edition of the "<em>Specilegium</em>" of
Linnæus contains two thousand and forty-two species, including the
Cryptogams. Wildmore, in another edition of the same great work, raised
the total to twenty thousand. And this was the point at which our
botanists had arrived when the nineteenth century opened.</p>

<p>But it was not long before they perceived that all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
estimates, large as they seemed, fell immeasurably short of the reality.
In attempting to distribute the different species among the then known
regions of the globe, Alexander von Humboldt arrived at a total of
forty-four thousand species, Phanerogams and Cryptogams included. De
Candolle extended the estimate to upwards of fifty-six thousand.</p>

<p>Let us divide, in fancy, the earth into two parts,&mdash;one which has
been visited by travellers, and one which still remains to be explored.
Can you determine which would present the larger area? The latter.</p>

<p>Thus we possess but a very imperfect knowledge of the luxuriant, the
glowing vegetation of the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the New
World, in spite of the labours of Bates, Agassiz, Wallace, and others. To
the north of the equator, we know very little of the flora of Yucatan,
Guatemala, Nicaragua, the isthmus of Panama, the Chaco of Antioquius,
the province of Los Pastos. We are not much better acquainted with the
vegetation of the countries south of the equator. What do we know of
the manifold species flourishing in Paraguay, in the province of the
Missions, in the immense wooded region between the Ucayali, the Rio de la
Madeira, and the Tocantin, three affluents of the mighty river Amazon? We
know scarcely anything.</p>

<p>Our ignorance increases if from America we pass to Africa. Nearly the
whole interior of this continent, from 15&deg; N. latitude to 20&deg; S.
latitude, is, botanically speaking, a blank to us. The same is the case
with the greater portion of Central Asia. The floras of the south and south-east of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Arabia are still sealed letters,&mdash;treasuries to which we have
not found the key. As much may be said of the floras of the countries
situated between the Thian-Schan, the Kuenlung, and the Himalaya, as
well as of the floras of western China, and most of the trans-Gangetic
countries. We know still less of the vegetation of the interior of
Madagascar, Borneo, New Guinea, and the greater part of Australia. To
conclude: we are probably not acquainted with more than one-fifth of the
vegetable species which cover the surface of our globe.</p>

<p>There are regions, moreover, which we imagine will always lie outside
of our sphere of investigation; such, for instance, are the Polar
regions, properly so called. Undoubtedly, it is open to us to conjecture
that the Poles&mdash;those two extremities of our axis of planetary
rotation&mdash;are not the home of any form of life. But this is only a
conjecture; we are even without an analogy for it; since we have found,
as shown in an earlier chapter of the present volume, living beings,
plants, and animals, among the snows of our loftiest mountains. Moreover,
might not the auroras, whose maximum of intensity occurs exactly at the
poles, render life possible in regions where we at present suppose it
to be <em>im</em>possible? Conjecture for conjecture,&mdash;acknowledge that
we here touch in both cases upon an element completely beyond our human
power.</p>


<p class="p1a">These, then, are the reasons why, at present, we can only venture upon
defining the <em>lower</em> limit, the <em>restricted</em> number, above
which we are unable to fix the total of vegetable species living on the
surface of our planet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>The method to be adopted has been indicated by Alexander von Humboldt
in his "Ansichten der Natur" ("Pictures of Nature"). His method consists
in the comparison of the vegetable families whose numerical relations
are <em>known</em>, with the number of species contained in our herbariums, or
cultivated in our botanical gardens.</p>

<p>But here, at the outset, a difficulty confronts us. Does any relation
exist between the classification of plants by natural families and by
their geographical distribution?</p>

<p>To group plants according to their analogies of structure, we study
them from an abstract point of view, and without any regard to the medium
in which they flourish. The question grows complicated if we also take
into consideration their characteristic conditions and their distribution
over the terrestrial surface. Families are then split asunder, and the
importance of our scientific classifications disappears.</p>

<p>The gathering together of a small number of species, represented by
innumerable individuals, confined within the same area, may suffice
to communicate to a landscape its characteristic physiognomy: as,
for example, is the case with the Asiatic steppes, the <em>landes</em> of
Brittany, the moors of Scotland, the palm-groves and the clumps of
Cactaceæ of tropical America. By the side of species which impress us
by their <em>mass</em>&mdash;that is, by the frequent reproduction of the same
individuals at an infinitesimal distance from one another&mdash;are
placed those much more numerous species which are everywhere very thinly
sown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>But do the plants themselves follow, from the equator to the poles,
the same law of <em>decrease</em> as obtains from the base to the summit
of the loftiest equatorial mountains?</p>

<p>Under identical isothermal lines, is the ratio of families known and
identified to the probable aggregate of Phanerogams the same, in the
temperate zone, on either side of the equator?</p>

<p>What are the vegetable families which preponderate at the two
extremes, represented by the torrid and the frigid zones?</p>

<p>Under the same geographical latitude, or between the same isothermal
lines, are the Synantheræ, the Gramineæ, the Leguminosæ, the Labiatæ,
the Cruciferæ, the Umbelliferæ, more numerous in the Old than in the New
World?</p>

<p>What families, either through their mass of individuals or their
number of species, take precedence of the other Phanerogams?</p>

<p>How many species of one and the same family belong to any particular
country?</p>

<p>What groups or families are characteristic of each zone?</p>

<p>Is the present classification of genera and species in all respects
what could be desired?</p>


<p class="p1a">These are questions that require to be considered, and to some of them
we shall presently attempt replies.</p>

<p>Herbariums, though their classification is too frequently imperfect,
may furnish us with data of great utility. The great herbarium of
Benjamin Delessert was estimated, after his death, to contain
86,000 species,&mdash;a total not widely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
differing from that which Lindley, in 1835, estimated as the
probable aggregate of the vegetable species of the world.</p>

<p>Great in importance are botanic gardens. Loudon, in his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hortus
Britannicus</i> (ed. 1832), places at 22,660 the number of Phanerogams
cultivated in the gardens of the Bristol amateur botanists. With this
number we must not confound the living species exhibited, in other
counties, in gardens designed for the instruction of students, nor the
grand total reared for a similar purpose at Kew. Kunth's enumeration, in
1861, of the plants at the Botanic Gardens at Berlin, one of the richest
in Europe, amounted to upwards of 14,000 species, including 375 heaths.
Among the Phanerogams were 1600 Synantheræ, 1150 Leguminosæ, 428 Labiatæ,
370 Umbelliferæ, 460 Orchidaceæ, 60 Palmaceæ, 600 Gramineæ and Cyperaceæ,
&amp;c. By comparing these data with the number of species described in
the works of De Candolle, Walpers, Bentham, Lindley, Kunth, and others,
we find that in the Berlin gardens are cultivated only one-seventh of the
known species of the Synantheræ, one-eighth of the Leguminosæ, one-ninth
of the Gramineæ, and about one-fiftieth of the smaller families, such as
the Labiatæ and Umbelliferæ.</p>


<p class="p1a">Now, if we admit that, on the one hand, the number of phanerogamous
species cultivated in all the great gardens of Europe is about 30,000,
and, on the other, that the cultivated Phanerogams form about one-eighth
part of the species described in books and preserved in herbariums, we
obtain a total of 24,000 species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Cryptogams, or Agams, such as heaths, mosses, lichens,
mushrooms, fungi, mould, and the like, of which our knowledge, as yet,
is very imperfect, are probably much more numerous in species than
the Phanerogams; for these vegetables, mostly microscopical, develop
themselves wherever life can manifest itself&mdash;on the barren and
denuded rocks, as well as in the air and in the depths of the ocean.
If we suppose that they exceed only by 2000 the estimated number of
Phanerogams, we shall obtain a total of just half-a-million!</p>

<p>Such, in our opinion, is the number which approximatively represents
the lower limit of the aggregate of vegetable species (phanerogamous and
cryptogamous) inhabiting our planet. The innumerable individuals of this
half-million of species are born, and live, and reproduce their kind,
and die, like the twelve hundred millions of individuals of our solitary
human species. The former, it is true, remain fixed to the soil which
has witnessed their birth, while the latter wander, more or less freely
over the terrestrial surface. Do not animals enjoy the same privilege of
locomotion? Undoubtedly. But men boast of the reason and the conscience
with which they are endowed. Agreed. But with the exception of a small
number&mdash;the infinite minority of progress&mdash;to what advantage
have men employed the reason and the conscience of which they boast?</p>


<p class="p1a">But this is a digression. We proceed to place before the
reader a few final data in illustration of the subject we have
been considering&mdash;the number of existing vegetable species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Harvest Bug.</span></p>

<p>"I very much wish," said my friend T. to me one day, "to buy a small
estate in the vicinity of &mdash;&mdash; Forest. If there should be one
to sell, pray let me know of it."</p>

<p>It was not long before an opportunity arose for my friend to satisfy
his desire. But after I had made him acquainted with it, he declared
himself no longer willing to purchase a property in a district where, as
he had learned, one was devoured by <em>red beasts</em> all through the
finest months of the year. What a frightful neighbourhood to live in,
where you were forbidden to walk in your garden under pain of catching an
itch in your legs!</p>

<p>Unquestionably, it is only too true that the cultivated ground,
whether on the northern or the southern slope of the forest, is infested,
from the beginning of summer to the beginning of winter, by Lilliputian
horrors, like so many tiny red points, which cling obstinately to the
skin, and there deposit, under the epidermis, their microscopic brood.
Once planted there, the <em>rougets</em>, as the French call them, or <em>harvest
bugs</em>, as we English call them, effect considerable mischief; and if, to
relieve one's self, one indulges in "a scratch," the cutaneous surface is
quickly covered by small blisters, which on a cursory examination might
be taken for a skin affection not generally named in polite hearing.</p>

<p>But one does not perceive the galleries excavated by these annoying
insects, positive tunnels or covered ways, through which they proceed to
pour forth elsewhere the superfluity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
their numerous progeny. Less prolific than the <em>Acari</em>, which
create upon the skin immense patches of irritation, the harvest bugs
confine themselves to a few circumscribed localities: their favourite
choice being the legs, the arms, and the corners of the eyes, especially
among young children. They are not above domestic animals; cats and dogs
frequently suffer from them,&mdash;not, indeed, over the whole surface of
the body, for they are not so wandering as the <em>Acari</em>,&mdash;but
particularly inside the shell of the ear.</p>

<p>At the first glance you would scarcely believe that those red points,
apparently immovable, could be living beings,&mdash;could be animals
belonging to an order of some importance.</p>


<p class="p1a">Let us attempt to isolate one of the animalcules with
the point of a pin: it is not an easy thing to do, because they usually
adhere to the epidermis in clusters of three or four individuals. There,
now we have succeeded, and here is one before us: it is only the fifth of
a millimètre in diameter, which is, for most people, the very last limit
of the visual function (see the small white line in Fig. 76, <i>a</i>). And,
in truth, it <em>would</em> be imperceptible to the eye but for its bright red
colour. To study it carefully, of course, you must make use of a very
strong lens, or, rather, of a microscope. (See Fig. 76, <i>b</i>.)</p>

<p>To this tiny animal has been given the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Leptus
autumnalis</i>; the first, on account of its extreme delicacy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the second, because it is visible up to the end of autumn.</p>

<p>When examined through a microscope, it produces on the spectator the
impression of a spider; but, like all other insects, it has only six
legs.</p>

<p>Our naturalists, however, have found some difficulty in classifying
it; and by way of cutting the Gordian knot of their embarrassments, some
have placed it in a separate family of <em>Microphthiræ</em> (literally
"little lice"), which is made to include all Arachnidæ with six legs.
Others, who regard the wheat worm as an insect, rank it among the
parasitical Apteræ.</p>

<p>In effect, it has all the characters of the parasitical
insect&mdash;its protracted head, distinct from the rest of its body, is
sometimes thrust forward in quest of its food, sometimes drawn back or
concealed, to protect it from danger. Intended to suck rather than to
knead or bruise, it has a sucker, but no mandibles. The head is without
antennæ, and its palpi are very short, barely visible, and of a conical
form. The body is ovular and very soft (whence the Grecian name <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">leptus</i>,
λεπτός, signifying "soft"). The anterior
part, corresponding to the thorax, is broader than it is long, and is
marked underneath, on each side of the central line, by a black point:
these two points, symmetrically placed, appear to represent the eyes.</p>

<p>The posterior portion, corresponding to the abdomen, is longer than it
is broad, and covered with hairs. Each leg consists of six joints, easily
distinguished by the hairs inserted at each articulation; and each
terminates in a couple of strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
crooked <em>claws</em>, which enable the animal to obtain a firm hold
on the skin.</p>


<p class="p1a">Thus, then, to judge from the aggregate of its characters,
the harvest bug, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Leptus autumnalis</i>, belongs
to the class Arachnidæ, while the number of its feet places it in the
class Insects. But this is a detail which causes little annoyance to
a person being devoured by the "red beasts," and only anxious to rid
himself of them.</p>

<p>But if such be his desire, let me tell him that the best remedies are
bathing the afflicted part with lotions of vinegar, or rubbing it with
sulphur ointment.</p>

<p>I have been asked whether certain tiny parasites, such as the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ocypete
rubra</i>,&mdash;which is also red, and has six feet like the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Leptus
autumnalis</i>, but which, instead of attacking man and his domestic
companions, attaches itself to flies,&mdash;I have been asked whether
these insectiform Arachnidæ may not be species of larva not yet arrived
at their matured condition.</p>

<p>For my part, I must acknowledge that, whether the <i xml:lang="la"
lang="la">Ocypete rubra</i> is or is not the transitory state of a more
perfect animal, I do not know. But I am sure that the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Leptus autumnalis</i>
lives and dies on the skin where it has selected its dwelling-place,&mdash;a
<em>living</em> dwelling-place.</p>


<p class="p1a">It is impossible to be too circumspect in the
determination of certain genera and species, whose different phases
of existence are little known, and which seem, so far as their
characteristics are concerned, to participate of several orders or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
classes of articulated animals. The errors which have been committed in
this respect ought at least to teach us caution.</p>

<p>Thus, the red, oval, six-legged animalcules, whose mobile heads are
furnished with a proboscis shaped like an angular beak, and whose two
palpi are large and semi-transparent,&mdash;the singular animalcules
which, in June or July, are hatched in the spongy stems of certain
aquatic vegetables,&mdash;notably the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Potamogeton natans</i>,&mdash;have
been described<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> as forming a
peculiar genus of Arachnidæ, the genus <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Achlysia</i>; and this
genus, created by Audouin, was ranked along with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Leptus</i>
and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ocypete</i> in the family of Microphthiræ. Yet nothing is
less exact. These Achlysia are simply the larvæ of a kind of
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hydrachna</i> or water-acarus. To be convinced of this, you have
but to watch their development. At first very small and pear-shaped,
these larvæ, deprived, like all larvæ, of the reproductive organs,
rapidly increase in size. At the end of a few weeks you will see them
adhering to a leaf of potamogeton; they thrust their proboscis into the
stem, and cling to it with their palpi. Little by little, the legs, the
proboscis, and the palpi, are drawn back towards the body, abandoning
the skin which has hitherto formed for each of these organs a kind of
horny sheath. From the larva state, the animal passes into that of the
nymph. But this nymph continues to feed and enlarge; proboscis, legs, and
palpi grow thinner and harder; claws, ciliæ, and hairs are developed;
and, finally, through a fissure in the skin emerges the perfect animal,
red as wine, with eight feet, and about two millimetres in length.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
This animal, placed in the family of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hydrachnellæ</i>, has been described by
De Geer under the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Acarus aquaticus globosus</i>, and by Dugès under
that of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hydrachna globosa</i>, on account of its globular form.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Cheese Mite.</span></p>

<p>From the crust of a dry old cheese,&mdash;such a kind of cheese
as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon-vivant</i> likes with a glass of "good old ale,"&mdash;a very
fine powder often crumbles off, like the dust made by wood-eating
worms.</p>

<p>Examine this powder with your lens, or if you have good
eyes, you may make use of <em>them</em>. You will quickly detect
something moving in it, and by degrees you will see that this movement
pervades the whole mass; that there is a general stir and commotion in
all directions.</p>

<p>But you find it impossible to distinguish clearly the form of the
animals which are thus agitated. You are certain, however, that they are
not maggots, for <em>they</em> affect moist cheeses; besides, they are visible
enough to everybody, and at need can make themselves <em>felt</em> upon your
hands, and even upon your face, for they have a faculty of launching
themselves to a distance by a little man&oelig;uvre familiar enough to
serpents: bringing the head round towards the tail, they curve themselves
like the spring of a watch, then abruptly uncoiling themselves with the
help of some solid <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">appui</i>, they fling forth into the air, and are thus
launched to very considerable distances. It is a curious species of
locomotion, not unworthy the attention of the mechanician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>To clear up the mystery of a movement whose cause is not apparent at
the first glance, let us sprinkle with this impalpable débris,&mdash;with
this kind of sawdust, or <em>cheese</em>-dust,&mdash;a little strip of glass,
and place it beneath the focus of a microscope.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 216px;">
<img src="images/i_372.jpg" width="216" height="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>&mdash;The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Acarus domesticus</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Ah! you exclaim, what a frightful creature! These long sharp ciliæ
seem to be so many lancets covering the whole body, and especially the
legs; its head, like that of the harvest-bug, protrudes and recedes under
a transparent carapace; thus communicating to the animal something of
the aspect of a turtle. In all other respects its form exactly resembles
the harvest-bug; only its body is more elongated towards the anterior
extremity than that of the latter. While the harvest-bug makes us
think of a spider, the body of the Acarus has a greater likeness to an
insect's. (Fig. 77.) Yet the Acarus has eight legs, like a spider, and
the harvest-bug six, like an insect. Attempt, then, to establish your
absolute rules!</p>

<p>Let us continue our observation of this cheese-worm. The
well-defined thorax forms nearly one-third of the fore-part of
the body, which is of a shining whitish-red or reddish-white.
The proboscis, shaped like a conical tube, is armed with two
projecting mandibles, which, like true pincers, can be brought
close together, or moved wide apart, thrust forward singly or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
simultaneously. Our animal, which a small lens makes very
distinct, has been more than once confounded with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sarcoptes
scabiei</i>.</p>

<p>Let us resume. Our cheese-dust, which to all appearance walks alone,
encloses legions of mites; the old you may detect by their eight feet,
the young by having six. The germs, or eggs, whence they spring, are
found mixed among the excrements of the living, and the débris of the
dead.</p>

<p>It is in this way that a crust of cheese offers us a true, a vivid
image of the terrestrial crust. So may we learn to compare small things
with great.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">How many Animal Species are there Distributed over
the Surface of the Globe?</span></p>

<p>In the present condition of scientific knowledge, no satisfactory
answer can be given to this important and most interesting question.</p>

<p>The truth is, that what we may call Geographical Zoology
is as yet in its very infancy. The few works which have been
published on the subject have been published within the last
eighty or ninety years; and they embrace only the vertebrate
animals, notably the mammals, birds, and reptiles, or amphibia.
We shall attempt to place before the reader an outline of the
results that have so far been obtained.</p>


<p class="p1a">Of all the Vertebrata, we are best acquainted with the
mammals. And yet our zoologists differ very widely in
respect to the number of their species, though the calculations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
have been made at very short intervals. For instance,
in 1829, Minding computed that the globe contained 1230
species of mammals. In 1832, Charles Bonaparte reduced
the total to 1149. Oken estimates it at 1500; and this last
figure would seem to be the most probable.</p>

<p>Nothing is more curious than the distribution of these 1500
species of mammals, according to the different regions and
climates of the globe.</p>

<p>Man, according to the best-considered data of science,
forms a single family, a single genus, a single species. He
alone possesses the power of adapting himself to every climate,
and of taking possession of countries the most widely opposite
in character. We find him among the snows of the North
Pole; we find him under the blazing sun of the Tropics. We
find him in the palm-fringed islands of Southern Seas, and in
the barren burning waste of the inhospitable Sahara. Considered
as an animal who feeds and reproduces himself, he
forms alone the order of <em>Bimana</em>; so named in opposition to
the <em>Quadrumana</em>, or apes, who make use of their fore-feet as
we do of our two hands. Deprive man of his progressive and
transmissible intellect&mdash;of those mysterious powers which we
call the mind and the soul&mdash;and he would become at once
the most useless and the most wretched member of the animal
world.</p>

<p>The warm regions of the old and new continents are the
true home and haunt of the apes. They are not sufficiently
developed to be able to frequent the temperate or frigid zone.
In our European menageries the specimens nearly all die of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
consumption. The Quadrumana form about one-fourteenth of
the whole number of species of Mammalia.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Carnivora</i>, characterised by the development of their
canine teeth, are spread over the whole globe. They are found in greater
numbers in the torrid, however, than in the frigid zone. Their species
compose at least one-third of the Mammalia.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rodentia</i>, characterised by the development of the incisors, are
wanting in Polynesia, and are rare in Australia. They are found in their
maximum number in the torrid zone. Like the Carnivora, they form about
one-third of the Mammalia.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ruminantia</i>, remarkable for the development of their digestive
apparatus, are distributed into 165 species, representing something less
than one-ninth of the Mammalia. Africa, of all the continents, is richest
in the Ruminants.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Marsupialia</i>, so strangely distinguished by the membranous pouch
in which they enclose their young, belong to America, and especially
Australia. At present about 123 species are known, or a little more than
one-thirteenth of the Mammalia.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Edentata</i>, so named on account of their incomplete dentition,
inhabit the tropical regions of the Old and New</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>World. They are distributed into 32 species, 19 of which belong to
America. The Edentata, therefore, do not form more than one-fiftieth of
the Mammalia.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pachydermata</i>, which owe their name to the thickness of their
skin or hide, almost exclusively belong to the Old World. None are found
in Australia. The number of their species is 38, of which 5 only belong
to Southern and Central America. The Pachyderms form, therefore, nearly
one-thirty-seventh of the Mammalia.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cetaceæ</i>,&mdash;which the naturalists of antiquity ranked
among the fishes, though the females bear their young alive, and are
furnished with a mammary apparatus,&mdash;chiefly frequent the Northern
waters, but some of their species are found in the South Pacific.
They represent, it may be assumed, about a one-hundredth part of the
Mammalia.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The <em>Birds</em>, by their feather-clad bodies, and by the transformation
of their two fore-limbs into wings, form the best-characterised
class in the whole animal kingdom. But naturalists
can no more agree as to the number of their species
than as to the number of species composing the Mammalia.
Some, taking as a foundation the rich ornithological collection
in the Berlin Museum, allow for 6000 species being distributed
over the surface of the globe; others, like Lessen, increase the
total to 6266; while Dr Gray, no mean authority, raises it to
at least 8000.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>The majority of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Raptores</i>, or birds of prey (vulture, falcon,
eagle), as well as nearly all the <em>Waders</em> (stork, crane, heron), and
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Palmipedes</i> (duck, goose, water-hen), are cosmopolitan birds. The
other orders, such as the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Scansores</i> (parrot, parroquet, magpie),
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Passeres</i> (comprising nearly all the singing birds), and the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gallinaceæ</i> (pheasant, pintado), prefer, as a general rule, the warm
temperate regions. They are not found in the extreme north, nor in the
equatorial climes, except in limited numbers.</p>

<p>[Of course, the foregoing is but an approximative estimate,
but it will provide the reader with a tolerably accurate
notion of the proportion borne by the different classes of
Mammalia.]</p>


<p class="p1a">About 5000 species of birds have been classified. By
Cuvier's system they are divided into six orders:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Raptores</i>, or birds of prey.</p>

<p>2. <em>Passerine birds</em>, now generally called <em>Insessores</em>, or Perching-birds.</p>

<p>3. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Scansores</i>, or Climbing, frequently called <em>Zygodactyli</em> or <em>Zygodactylous</em>
birds.</p>

<p>4. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gallinaceæ</i>, now more frequently known as <em>Rasores</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Grallatores</i>, Waders, or Stilt birds.</p>

<p>6. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Palmipedes</i>, or Web-footed birds, now more generally recognised
as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Natatores</i>, or Swimmers.</p></blockquote>

<p>It has been proposed to separate the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Brevipennes</i>, or
short-winged birds, from the Grallatores, and erect them into a
separate order.</p>


<p class="p1a">The <em>Reptiles</em>, of which the majority possess the faculty of
living upon land and in water,&mdash;whence their name of
Amphibia,&mdash;never pass beyond the limits of warm and
temperate climates: their blood, which has the same temperature
as the medium wherein they live&mdash;whence their
name of "cold-blooded animals"&mdash;does not circulate where
the mean annual temperature descends below freezing-point.
Yet frogs and salamanders have been met with in Greenland,
and on the banks of the Mackenzie River, in North America,
under 67&deg; latitude.</p>


<p class="p1a">Linnæus was not acquainted with more than 215 species
of <em>Amphibia</em>, divided into four orders:&mdash;the Chelonians, or
tortoises; the Saurians (as the lizard and crocodile); the
Ophidians (serpents); and the Batrachians (frogs). In 1789,
Lacépède raised the total to 303; in 1820, Merrem estimated
it at 677. At present, the number of species of Reptilia
classified and described amounts to 2000, and the four
orders into which they are distributed are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ophidia</i>, or Serpents.</p>

<p>2. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sauria</i>, or Lizards.</p>

<p>3. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Loricata</i>, or Crocodiles.</p>

<p>4. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chelonia</i>, or Tortoises.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Sching, there are 7 tortoises, 33 serpents, and
35 lizards.</p>


<p class="p1a"><em>Fishes</em> are the least known of those superior
animals whose skeleton and vertebral column are situated in the interior
of the body, and which are thence named <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vertebrata</i>. The richest
collections, such as those of the British Museum, and those of the Museum
of Natural History in Paris, which contain about 3000 species, do not
represent probably more than a fourth of the existing total, including
fresh-water and salt-water fish. How many rivers and streams in both
hemispheres still remain to be explored! How far we are from a knowledge
of the fishes which people the different strata of the great ocean.</p>

<p>Agassiz divides this great class of vertebrated animals into the
four orders of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cycloid, Ctenoid, Placoid, and Ganoid</i>, according
to the character of their scales. Cuvier, into <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Osseous</i> fishes
(with true bones), and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cartilaginous</i>; subdividing the former into
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Acanthopterygii</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Malacopterygii</i>.</p>


<p class="p1a">The difficulty of the problem we are here considering
increases when we come to the inferior animals. Who would pretend to
determine the number of species of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mollusca</i> which inhabit the earth,
the fresh waters and the salt? This much is certain, that it cannot be
less than that of the Vertebrates.</p>


<p class="p1a">In the vast aggregate of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Articulata</i>, the inquirer finds
himself utterly astray and bewildered. This great division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
is not divided into those which have, and those which have not,
articulated members.</p>

<p>The first subdivision includes <em>Insects</em>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arachnida</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Crustacea</i>,
and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Myriapoda</i>; the second, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Annelida</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Entozoa</i>.</p>

<p>Some naturalists, be it said, rank the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cirrhopoda</i> as intermediate
between the two; others place them among the Mollusca. Others, again,
include the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rotifera</i> in the second subdivision.</p>

<p>We shall in this place confine our remarks to the <em>Insects</em>. According
to the most distinguished entomologists, the average number of species
at present, described or not described, and preserved in entomological
collections, is between 150,000 and 170,000.</p>

<p>This estimate is obviously below the truth. Take only the Coleoptera,
which forms but one, though, it is true, the most numerous order of
insects. Thirty years ago the most complete collections contained about
7000 species. In 1850, the museum at Berlin, according to Alexander
von Humboldt, contained nearly 32,000. We would here call the reader's
attention to the just remarks of the author of the "Natural History
of the Coleoptera," an entomologist of great authority, whom a long
residence in America had peculiarly qualified to pronounce an opinion on
the subject before us:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we remember," says the Count de Castelnau, "that
there are immense regions in Asia and the two Americas of
which we do not possess a single coleoptera; if we reflect that
the interior of the vast continent of New Holland is, from this
standpoint, entirely unknown, and that most of the archipelagoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
of the great ocean have never been entomologically explored, we may
conclude, without any fear of mistake, that the number of existing
coleopteras exceeds <em>one hundred thousand</em>. However frightful this
number may appear, it will seem less so if we examine only the species
discovered in the neighbourhood of Paris, within a radius of twelve to
fifteen leagues; and we do not hesitate to say, that in a few years the
Parisian fauna alone will present material for a considerable work, which
shall not treat of less than 3000 to 4000 species of Coleoptera."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>


<p class="p1a">If we admit that the other orders of insects, the
Lepidoptera, the Hemiptera, the Hymenoptera, the Neuroptera, the
Orthoptera, the Diptera, the Strepsiptera, comprise, taken altogether, at
least the same number of species as the Coleoptera alone, we shall gain,
for the class of insects, a total of 200,000. And we shall certainly keep
within the truth if we assign the same number of species to the Annelida,
the Crustacea, the Arachnida, the Myriapoda, and the Monomorpha, to
which, with some modification, we may apply the remarks already called
forth by the Coleoptera.</p>

<p>Let us recapitulate. The four classes of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vertebrate Animals</i> include
approximatively:&mdash;</p>

<p>If we add to these 20,600 species of Vertebrate Animals, 200,000
species of Articulata, and 22,000 Mollusca (a minimum), we shall have a
total of 242,600.</p>

<p>But to complete the grand whole of beings "who grow, and live, and
feel" (the definition of animals laid down by Linnæus), we must add the
Intestinal Worms, the Echinodermata, the Acalephæ (or Sea-nettles), and
the Polypes. The history of these singular creatures, which apparently
form the transition between the animal and vegetable kingdom, and have
thence been designated <em>Zoophytes</em>, leaves much, very much, to be
desired before it will be possible to indicate, even approximatively, the
number of their species.</p>


<p class="p1a">And, finally, what shall we say of the Infusoria? These
microscopic forms of life seem, by their extreme multiplicity, to
animate all nature. It is in studying these that the inquirer needs
to be constantly on his guard, that he may not mistake transitory
conditions&mdash;or larvæ&mdash;for actual species, and it behoves him to
understand thoroughly the difficult delimitation of specific characters.
It would be far easier to ascertain the exact number of human beings who
at present people the terrestrial surface, than to fix the total of the
species of Infusoria now in existence; assuredly it exceeds 250,000. What
an infinite variety of design is here! What a picture it presents of the
inexhaustibility of the Creative Mind!</p>


<p class="p1a">Add, then,&mdash;let us say, in conclusion,&mdash;to this last great
total the aggregate of the Vertebrates, the Articulates, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
the Molluscs, and for our grand whole we have a minimum of <em>half a
million</em> of <span class="smcap">animal species</span>! This is the
very figure, observe, at which we arrived as representing the lowest
limit of the totality of <span class="smcap">vegetable species</span>,
living and moving, flourishing, and dying, and reproducing, on the
surface of the globe.</p>

<p>We leave the reader to meditate&mdash;as meditate he surely
must&mdash;on the sublime thoughts, the overpowering ideas of Power and
Wisdom which these considerations suggest.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">What is Chlorophyll?</span></p>

<p>We are drawing towards the close of autumn; we shall soon be in sight
of the "melancholy days of the year;" when, for a while, the "voice of
the turtle" will cease in the leafless groves, and the banks and braes
will be sadly bare of their floral garniture. As yet, however, the trees
retain their glorious vesture, though streaked and varied with the
gorgeous colours of decay; and in the sheltered corners of the woods, on
the sunny southern slope of the grassy hill, and beneath the covert of
the still fragrant hedgerow, many a blossom appeals to our souls with its
promptings of sweet images and tender fancies. The arum still raises its
clusters of deep-scarlet berries, and spreads its spotted leaf&mdash;</p>

<p>the blue-bells hang their delicate cups among the thick herbage;
and the wild marigold contrasts its yellow splendour
with all this crimson and azure magnificence. The daisy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
too, has not forsaken us&mdash;sweet shield of silver, embossed with

<p>To what do the leaves, now changing their hues so rapidly,
and varying through all the tints of purple, brown, and yellow,&mdash;to
what do they owe their normal colour, the fresh, vivid,
beautiful green?</p>

<p>To a substance called <em>chlorophyll</em>&mdash;(χλωρὸς, green, and
φυλλον, a leaf).</p>

<p>Well, what <em>is</em> chlorophyll?</p>

<p>The colouring matter of plants, which, accompanied by
grains of starch, floats like very minute seeds in the fluid of
their cells. In some respects it is analogous to wax; it will not
dissolve in water, but is easily affected by ether or alcohol.</p>

<p>Chlorophyll is dependent upon the action of light, if not
for its formation, at all events for its development. Keep a
plant in a dark room or cellar, and it will become blanched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
and sickly; the colouring matter dries up, and the white, wan
tissue of the leaf is all that survives. The more a plant is exposed
to the light, the deeper will be its green. In a shrubbery
you may notice that the brown leaves of any particular ever-green
or bush, if so situated as to lose the direct action of the
sun's rays, will soon change colour. Instead of their natural
brightness of tint, they assume a sickly greenish-yellow hue,
and are said to be suffering from <em>chlorosis</em>. The formation of
the chlorophyll is obstructed, or takes place too slowly. Of
course, this peculiar condition will frequently arise from bad
soil, or a long continuance of damp weather; but it is also the
result of a want of light.</p>

<p>It should be observed that young leaves are always of a lighter
green than old; simply because the latter have been exposed
for a longer time to the light. And so the leaf goes on deepening
and deepening in colour, until the sad days of autumn come, and
the green gives way to yellow and brown and red, owing to the
influence of the changing season on the chlorophyll of the plant.</p>

<p>In reference to this interesting subject,&mdash;which deserves to
be more closely investigated,&mdash;we may place before the reader
the results of certain recent experiments.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>MM. Prillieux, Brongniart, and Roze (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Comptes Rendus</i>, Jan.
3 and 17) have made some important observations on the
apparently spontaneous movements of the grains of chlorophyll
within the leaves of plants. These had been observed by
Böhm to congregate under the direct action of the sun;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Famitzin, confirmed by Borodine, had also recorded very marked movements
in the leaves of a moss under the influence of light. This class of
plants offer great facilities for these observations, inasmuch as
the movements can be observed in them under the microscope without
dissection. M. Prillieux kept a moss in the dark for several days, when
the cells presented the appearance of a green network, between the meshes
of which was a clear transparent ground. All the grains of chlorophyll
were applied to the walls which separate the cells from one another;
there were none on the upper or under walls which form the surfaces of
the leaf. Under the influence of light the grains change their position
from the lateral to the superficial walls; under favourable circumstances
this change takes place in about a quarter of an hour. On attaining
their new position, the grains do not remain absolutely immovable, but
continually approach and separate from one another. If again darkened,
they leave their new position and return to the lateral walls. Artificial
light produces the same effect as daylight. M. Brongniart further
observed that this movement of the chlorophyll, under the influence of
light, does not consist in the change of position of isolated grains,
but of masses of network, each containing a certain number of grains.
In addition, M. E. Roze states that, besides the grains of chlorophyll
which coat the walls of the cell, each cell is lined with a transparent
mucous plasma formed of very fine threads, the extremities of which unite
together the grains of chlorophyll. This protoplasm exhibits, under a
high magnifying power, a very slow motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and carries the grains of chlorophyll along with it. M. Roze
believes, therefore, that the motion is a plasmic one, the protoplasm
being the vital and animating part of the cell.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Carnations and Pinks.</span></p>

<p>Among the latest flowers of the autumnal garden are those old
favourites, the "July-flowers," or <em>Carnations</em>, which, because
they were "fair and sweet and medicinal," Jeremy Taylor preferred to "the
prettiest tulips, that are good for nothing." I remember a time when they
were among the best-prized ornaments of our parterres, and very delicious
it was to inhale the balmy breath that rose into the warm air of an
autumn evening from rich masses of carnations and pinks. The carnations
were also called&mdash;<em>sub consule Planco</em>&mdash;in the merry
days when I haunted the green lanes of a pretty Devonshire village,
carnations, and clove July-flowers or gilliflowers; and an ancient name
for the pink was that of sops-in-wine, because they were infused in the
wine-cups of our much-drinking ancestors. So Drayton says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Bring hither the pink and purple columbine,</div>
  <div class="i4">With gilliflowers;</div>
  <div class="i0">Bring coronations, and sops-in-wine,</div>
  <div class="i4">Worn of paramours."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same poet alludes to them under their more modern
appellations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The brave carnation, then, of sweet and sovereign power</div>
  <div class="i0">(So of his colour called, although a July flower),</div>

  <div class="i0">Then the odoriferous pink, that sends forth such a gale</div>
  <div class="i0">Of sweetness, yet in scents as various as in sorts."</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>The scientific name of this beautiful family of plants, whose
rich dyes are not less conspicuous than their Sabæan odours,
is <em>Dianthus</em>, or "Flower of God." They form a genus of the
natural order Carophyllaceæ; the calyx is tubular, and five-toothed;
there are five petals, which at the throat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
corolla are lightened (as it were) into a linear "claw." The
stamens are double the number of the petals; the capsule is
of a cylindrical outline, and one-celled.</p>

</div>

<p>I am quite prepared to agree with a sympathetic writer on flowers
that, during summer, and far into the autumn months, the greatest
beauty of our gardens is the varied tribe of Carnations, while their
exquisite, subtle, yet potent aroma is not to be excelled, I think,
or, at all events, is not far surpassed, in strength and sweetness, by
the much-lauded rose. A carnation seems, to my humble taste, the very
embodiment, as it were, of the favourite qualities so insisted upon by
Mr Matthew Arnold, "sweetness and light." And even in winter, when its
radiant petals have disappeared, there is something graceful to the eye
in the long slender leaves of the pink, covered with their sea-green
powdery bloom.</p>

<p>The two species commonly grown in gardens are, the garden
pink (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dianthus hortensis</i>) and the carnation proper (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dianthus
caryophyllus</i>); both of which are generally referred to one original,
the castle-pink, July-flower, or clove-gilliflower. The carnation, as a
garden flower, was originally brought into England from Germany, where it
has always been a favourite object of cultivation.</p>

<p>There are several hundred varieties of it, which are arranged into
three principal divisions: <em>flakes</em>, which are diversified by broad
stripes of two colours only; <em>bizarres</em>, which are of several colours,
and very irregularly streaked; and <em>picotees</em> (from <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">piquetté</i>, spotted),
whose flowers are besprinkled with different colours, and their petals
fringed or serrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>In England, the <em>native</em> species of pink are five in number,
but they are mostly rare, or, when abundant, are found in very limited
habitats.</p>

<p>The commonest kind is the little <em>Deptford Pink</em> (<em>Dianthus
Armeria</em>), which sometimes grows in thick clusters among the meadow
grass. In shape, its blossom resembles that of the garden pink; in size,
it is about equal to that of the sweet william; and its flowers grow in
a very similar manner. It is a scentless pink, however, with serrated or
notched petals, and its rose-coloured petals curiously besprinkled with
tiny spots of white.</p>

<p>A very pretty species is the <em>Maiden Pink</em> (<em>Dianthus
deltoides</em>), which some botanists think to have been the original
of our garden favourite; and a kind deserving notice for its large and
fragrant flowers is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dianthus superbus</i>.</p>

<p>The maiden pink, I should add, has delicate rose-coloured blossoms,
daintily touched with silver, and a white eye encircled by a deep purple
ring. It is not unworthy of its fanciful and highly suggestive name.</p>

<p>A rare British variety is the <em>Clustered Pink</em>, or <em>Childing Pink</em>
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dianthus prolifer</i>), which produces its flowers in plentiful clusters,
but is only allowed a season's sunshine.</p>

<p>The <em>India</em> or <em>China Pink</em> (<em>Dianthus chinensis</em>) is a native of
Eastern Asia, but has now become a frequent denizen in our English
gardens.</p>

<p>One wild species, the <em>Mountain Pink</em> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dianthus c&oelig;sius</i>), it
has never been my fortune to gather in its native home. It is
described as a large handsome flower, and it loves to breathe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
the "difficult air" of the lofty mountain-top. "Never," we are told, "is
it found in plain or valley; but it is one of those blossoms whose beauty
gladdens the mountaineer, or bids the traveller wonder that so lovely
a flower should be blushing on the lone summit, scarcely accessible to
his footstep; or cheering a rock, where only the yellow lichen, or the
verdant or gray moss, reminds him of vegetation. Such a sight might bid
one think of the old motto, which accompanied a wild flower, 'I trust
only in Heaven.' How beautiful is it in its loneliness! Scarce an eye
meets it but that of the towering bird, as he dashes through the air
above it, yet is it as full of lustre as the flowers we daily see and
admire. Surely it should arrest the eye and the thoughts of the traveller
as certainly as would a monument of human skill on such a spot. Like a
lone ruin, it is a page of story, telling not only of the past, but the
present, and reminding us of a Being who has reared it there, where it
stands a memento of power and goodness."</p>

  <div class="i7"><span style="margin-left: 8em;">&mdash;</span><span class="smcap">Wordsworth.</span></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of greater interest, however, because a native species, and more
easily attained, is the <em>Castle Pink</em>, to which brief reference
has already been made. Its perfume is like that of precious spices,
and after a shower of rain, the air, for some distance, is actually
interpenetrated with it. As its name indicates, it loves to grow upon the
shattered walls of</p>

<div class="container">
 <div class="text">
<p>"Chiefless castles breathing stern farewells;"</p>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.</span>&mdash;"On the time-worn ruins of an ancient minster."</p></div>
</div>

<p>and it may be found, unless swept away by barbarous "improvements,"
adorning the gray old masonry of Sandown Castle, and on ruins in the
neighbourhood of Norwich. On the walls of Rochester's stately keep it
grows at a height which defies the spoiler's hand; and on the time-worn
ruins of an ancient minster, it shines, in the summer-noon, "with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
flush of flowers." It blossoms in July, and there are not, it is
said, more than half-a-dozen spots in England where it may
be found wild.</p>


<p class="p1a">To this dainty and beautiful tribe belongs that common but
handsome and most fragrant flower, the <em>Bearded Pink</em> or <em>Sweet William</em>
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dianthus barbatus</i>),&mdash;a native of central Europe and southern
France, with long lanceolate leaves, bearded petals, ornamental bracts,
and dense clusters or tufts of crimson or rose-coloured blossoms. It
has long been a favourite with the cottager, for it is so hardy that it
will grow in any soil, and will flourish even in the odd corner known
as the "children's garden." Its popular name, "long, long ago," was
"London tuftes;" and it owes its specific appellation of <em>barbatus</em>,
or "bearded," to the nature of its calyx. That quaintest of quaint old
botanists, delightful Gerarde, lavishes encomiums upon its beauty, and
pronounces it meet "to deck up the bosoms of the beautiful, and garlands
and crowns for pleasure." I suspect that now-a-days it seldom figures in
a posy.</p>


<p class="p1a">To the same order as the Dianthi&mdash;that is, to
the <em>Caryophyllaceæ</em>&mdash;belong many wild flowers of lowly
growth but abounding interest; as, for example, the corn-cockle, whose
lilac-coloured petals, soaring conspicuously among the tall waving corn,
have procured for it the right royal appellation of <em>Agrostemma</em>,
or "the crown of the field." So, too, the numerous species of campion and
catchfly (<em>Silene</em>), with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
singular expanded calices; and those handsome flowers, the
white and rosy lychnises, which love to air their charms by
the side of running waters. The cottony down upon these
plants was wont to be much used for the wicks of lamps.</p>


<p class="p1a">Then, too, the whole tribe of chickweeds are included in
the Caryophyllaceæ. They are spring flowers, with pearly white blossoms,
five-petalled, like a five-rayed star, and long slender drooping
leaves. Their resemblance to a star has suggested their scientific
name, <em>Stellaria</em>; and they are truly the "stars of the earth,"
glistering among the thick herbage with a modest beauty. The <em>Stellaria
media</em> supplies our song-birds with an abundant and a wholesome
provision.</p>

<p>A handsome wild plant of this order is the Soapwort (<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Saponaria
officinalis</i>). It is common in Kent, and some of the neighbouring shires,
but in many parts of England is never seen. Its full cluster of rose-hued
blossoms is rather larger, and more loosely set together, than those of
the sweet william; which, however, it much resembles in its leaves, these
being opposite to each other, and nearly sheathing or surrounding the
stalk at their bases.</p>

<p>"The juice of the soapwort," says Miss Pratt, "is one of those
vegetable substances which, by making a lather with water, will cleanse
linen, and remove grease as effectually as soap. It grows more generally
in the neighbourhood of villages than in any other situation, as if
providence had placed it there especially for the service of the
cottager; yet it is very little used, either from ignorance of its properties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
or because it would require some cultivation to render it sufficiently
plentiful for household purposes. It needs the addition of ashes to
make it a good soap for washing linen; but it is of much service to the
shepherds on the Alps, who wash their flocks, previously to shearing
them, with soapsuds made by boiling this plant in water. The large fruit
of the horse-chestnut has similar cleansing properties, and may be used
by cutting it into small pieces, or scraping it into water. It has even
been suggested that if the nuts were reduced to powder, and made into
balls, with some unctuous substance, they would answer all the purposes
of our manufactured soap; and yet numbers of poor people see these nuts
lying decaying in their neighbourhood, and have no idea of making them of
any service."</p>

<p>On the Continent, however, the peasantry are wiser, and not only
provide themselves with chestnuts for soap, but gather the beech-leaves
to stuff their mattresses.</p>

<p>Returning to the Caryophyllaceæ, we may add that some of the plants
of this order have poisonous qualities, which are due to the principle
called <em>saponine</em> existing in many of the species of Saponaria, Silene,
Lychnis, and Dianthus.</p>

<p>According to Lindley, the order includes no less than 53 genera, and
1055 species. They inhabit chiefly temperate and cold regions, and are
ranked in three sub-orders,&mdash;Alsineæ, Sileneæ, and Mollugineæ.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Eglantine and the Convolvulus.</span></p>

<p>What plant do our poets mean by the eglantine? What by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
the woodbine? Are they one and the same, or are they
different?</p>

<p>We cannot answer those questions until we have referred
to three or four passages in which they are introduced. And,
first, let us take an example from Spenser:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">"And over him, art striving to compare</div>
  <div class="i2">With nature, did an arbour green dispread,</div>
  <div class="i2">Framèd of wanton ivy, flowering fair,</div>
  <div class="i2">Through which the fragrant eglantine did spread</div>
  <div class="i2">His pricking arms, entrailed with roses red,</div>
  <div class="i2">Which dainty odours round about them threw,</div>

  <div class="i2">That when wild Zephyrus amongst them blew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Did breathe out bounteous smells, and painted colours shew."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And now from Milton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Through the sweetbriar, or the vine,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or the twisted eglantine."</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>From Michael Drayton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The azured harebell next with them they neatly mixt:</div>

  <div class="i0">"And leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,</div>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is evidently some confusion here, and the eglantine of
one poet is not the eglantine of another. Sir Walter Scott, we
take it, is thinking of the wild clematis or virgin's bower, when
he wishes the eglantine to remain untrimmed. And Milton
undoubtedly refers to the honeysuckle, which, twisting round
the framework of a cottage-porch, tempts the neighbouring bees
to rifle its calyxes of their honeyed sweets. But the <em>true</em> eglantine
of our earlier poets seems to have been the prickly sweetbriar,
formerly called <em>Rosa eglantina</em>; now known as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rosa
rubiginosa</i>. No plant is of greater value for a garden hedge,
owing to the delicious fragrance exhaled not only by its flowers
but by its leaves.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the "lush woodbine," which so often
finds honourable mention in our poets, is none other than the
honeysuckle, the "twisted eglantine" of Milton. Its botanical
name is <em>Caprifolium</em>.</p>

<p>The eglantine and the woodbine, therefore, though occasionally
confounded by careless writers, are two entirely distinct
plants; the former being the sweetbriar of modern gardens,
and the latter the honeysuckle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.</span>&mdash;"Our leafy hedgerows."</p></div>
</div>

<p>It has been justly said by a writer (whom we have already
quoted), that of all the flowers which, towards the end of
summer and the beginning of autumn, adorn our pastoral
scenery, "filling the air with fragrance, and the earth with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
beauty," none are more generally attractive than the wild
climbing plants of our leafy hedgerows. By interlacing their
delicate boughs, covered with foliage and flowers,&mdash;or with
berries bright and sparkling,&mdash;or, as in the wild clematis,
crowned with the lightest, feathery seeds,&mdash;they wind about
the trees and bushes in festoons and wreaths of the utmost
elegance,&mdash;and contribute in no slight degree to the aspect of
richness and beauty which the landscape exhibits at this time
of the year. As their stems are so slender and delicate that
they would be crushed by the burthen of their flowery clusters
and numerous leaves, or rent and uprooted by the wind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
unless they found support from other plants, we see them hanging by
their tendrils, or by their pliant arms, about the trunks of aged
trees,&mdash;the ancestral elms, or "those green-robed senators of mighty
woods, tall oaks,"&mdash;like a frail maiden to the sturdy arm of some
strong-shouldered brother, or, it may be, of some one "nearer and dearer
still."</p>

<p>In reference to those climbing plants, one curious circumstance
deserves to be noted.</p>

<p>Some of them follow the sun's apparent course, that is, from east
to west,&mdash;and always twine around the stem which supports them in
the direction of left to right. Such is the case with the common black
briony, so common in our woods and groves.</p>

<p>Others invariably twine <em>contrary</em> to the sun, or from right to
left; as is the case with the convolvulus, or large white bindweed.</p>

<p>This singular tendency, be it observed, is always constant in each
individual of the species, and if you endeavour to train one of these
plants in a different direction, you will infallibly kill it.</p>

<p>The convolvulus will not grow from left to right, and the black briony
will not grow from right to left. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Crede experto.</i></p>

<p>The convolvulus, or white bindweed (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Convolvulus sepium</i>,
or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Calystegia sepium</i>), is one of the most elegant, though one of
the commonest climbing plants which festoon our willows, or
creep over our grassy banks, or wind in and about our hedges.
Its large white bells, which the country people unpoetically
call "old men's nightcaps," are remarkable for their purity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
hue and exquisite beauty of outline; and the leaves, which are
heart-shaped, equally claim our admiration. Like the pink field-convolvulus
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Convolvulus arvensis</i>), or the rosy-hued seaside
bindweed (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Calystegia soldanella</i>), it is very tenacious of life, and
if it once secures a footing, is eradicated with difficulty. Hence it is
dearer to the poet and artist than to the farmer and gardener, each of
whom pursues it with a determined hostility.</p>

<p>The Convolvulaceæ form a distinct family or order, containing
forty-five genera, and upwards of seven hundred species. They are found
in temperate and tropical countries; and include the dodder, sweet
potato, scammony, spom&oelig;a, and the jalap plant.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Metamorphosis.&mdash;A Physico-Philosophical Meditation.</span><a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>If we are to understand by the term <em>metamorphosis</em> simply "a
change," it is evident that everybody undergoes metamorphosis, is changed
or transformed; nothing <em>is</em>, all <em>becomes</em>.</p>

<p>The water which flows on for ever, but never twice washes the same
pebbly bed, will afford us an apt image of this perpetual "to become."</p>

<p>But even the said pebbly bed, like the hardest rock, like the
seemingly everlasting granite, must and does change. The compact,
chrystalline, azoic rock, without a trace of life in its dense mass,
would eventually decompose if constantly assailed and affected by the
moving waves of that gaseous ocean whose bed is formed by the terrestrial
crust. If the rock is found covered by more or less stratified layers,
its presence in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
bosom of the earth will attest to passing generations the primordial
incandescence of our planet at some epoch when life as yet was
<em>not</em>,&mdash;when the liquid element, hurled far away into space under
the form of vapour, exhibited the aspect of a "bearded meteor," or a
comet, with blazing nucleus and incandescent tail. Many the changes which
since that distant epoch have taken place upon the earth, and many more
must occur before our planet ceases to contribute its strain to the grand
harmony of the spheres. Our world will <em>end</em> as surely as it once had a
beginning: its duration, though it be computed by hundreds of thousands
of years, is nothing, will be nothing, compared with that of the
revolution of yonder sun, circling, with its wondrous train of planets,
around some mysterious centre as yet unknown. And in this period,
hitherto incalculable, what chances of perturbation will necessarily
arise?</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the centre around which oscillates, on the one
part, the moon while drawing near and receding from the earth; on the
other, the earth while drawing near and receding from the sun: let
us suppose that these centres oscillate in the same manner around
other centres as yet undetermined,&mdash;and this hypothesis is very
rational, since it is based on the principle that everything moves or
changes,&mdash;it may happen that in these periodical oscillations, one
or more of the circulating masses will eventually fall into their focus
of attraction, or will start so widely astray that the wheelwork of our
world, the various parts of our planetary system, will
separate,&mdash;not to be annihilated, for nothing in the universe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
can be <em>annihilated</em>,&mdash;but to be metamorphosed, and group
themselves elsewhere in a different order.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>It is thus that in chemistry, which I would call the
<em>astronomy of atoms</em>, it is shown that bodies are only so far
decomposed as to admit of their recombination in new forms;
the end of one is the beginning of another.</p>

<p>Now, that which is true of the systems of the elementary
bodies composing terrestrial matter, is, in all probability, true
also&mdash;why should it not be?&mdash;of the systems of the celestial
bodies.</p>

<p>Differences of magnitude, of space, and of time, which overwhelm
our feeble imaginations, vanish before the unity of plan
of the Creator's thought. A crystalline molecule, which will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
not affect the finest balance, is a world, with an equator and poles
of its own, and its central atom round which atomic satellites
gravitate. Whether these atoms are infinitely small or infinitely
great, whether the time of their revolutions is measured by thousandths
of a second or by myriads of years, is of little importance so far
as their gravitation (<em>ponderation</em>, or <em>poising</em>) is
concerned. For this ponderation is absolutely identical, whether
we call it <em>affinity</em>,&mdash;when speaking of the atomic
movements of chemically decomposable matter; or <em>gravitation</em> or
<em>attraction</em>, when referring to those atoms of the great whole
which we call stars, and whose metamorphic scale is far beyond the range
of beings planted on the surface of one of the stellar atoms. However
profound may be the researches of our astronomers, they will never attain
to a knowledge of the metamorphoses of worlds. The spectacle of celestial
spheres rising anew from their ashes, like "the Arabian bird" of fable,
will be as impossible for them as the knowledge of the decompositions and
recompositions of our material bodies would be for chemists, planted on
the surface of an atom of carbon. How, from such a standpoint, could they
contemplate the manifold forms of matter, and embrace at a glance all
its changes?... Well, we are relatively as powerless as these imaginary
denizens of an atom of matter, rooted as we are to the crust of a
planet,&mdash;a molecule suspended in the eternal ocean.</p>

<p>What shall we now say of the forms and movements of <em>living
matter</em>?</p>

<p>In the first place, that they are infinitely more varied and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
more changeful than those of inanimate nature. Next, that the difference
between their metamorphoses is very wide. The eye can follow the
transformations of a rock exposed to the decomposing action of the
agents which surround us on every side. This action is calculable, and
the elements which it has dissociated may be determined and weighed.
The effects of the force, called either affinity or attraction, which
maintains these elements united, are not beyond the range of our
observation; tables of affinity, and of atomic weights, have been
constructed, which enable the chemist to dominate over matter, just as
the astronomer embraces the stars, the atoms of the world, by the law of
universal gravitation.</p>

<p>But no sooner is matter interpenetrated by that mysterious force
which we call life, than our most potent means of investigation suddenly
cease to be efficient. Undoubtedly, you may analyse the seed before you
sow it, and thus may ascertain that it consists of <em>carbon</em>,
<em>hydrogen</em>, <em>oxygen</em>, and <em>azote</em>. But with the
same elements attempt to recompose your seed, using exactly the same
proportions as those you discovered in it; and if you think that
your synthesis has been successful, ensure that your grain, once
confided to the earth, shall become a focus of divers movements,
giving birth below to the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ramificacations'">ramifications</ins> of the root, terminated by the
spongioles,&mdash;above, to the ramifications of the stem, garnished
with leaves, flowers, and fruits; finally, ensure that this aggregate of
organs, multiplying millions of times the weight and volume of the seed,
shall always and exactly reproduce the same type or the same species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>If, with your apparatus,&mdash;if, with the means at the disposal of
humanity,&mdash;you should succeed in achieving all these marvels of
nature; then perhaps you might settle the great problem of what life
is,&mdash;whether an independent force, or a simple modification of an
universal force, of which heat, light, electricity, and magnetism, will
be but different modes of manifestation.</p>

<p>And yet, even in such a case, you must not boast too loudly of your
power; for you will find it necessary to turn and return the term you
have arrived at, in every direction; nor will it furnish you with the
relation or the cause of the formidable progression whose <em>alpha</em> and
<em>omega</em>, whose beginning and end, escape us so absolutely.</p>

<p>Whence, in all its interminable metamorphoses, whence comes life?
Whither goes it? Were our world to perish, its ruins would not cease,
in their apparently <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'disorderd'">disordered</ins> movements, to obey the law of universal
gravitation: they would so group themselves as to form other worlds,
resembling the system of which they were anteriorly the framework. But
this force in no wise tells you why, when, and how life will make its
appearance on these spheroids of revolution, which, in their state of
ponderation, are attracted in the direct ratio of their masses and in the
inverse ratio of the square of their distances.</p>


<p class="p1a">This is not all. Man justly plumes himself on having
arrived, by a process of experiment, at the following irrefragable
axiom: that "the matter which serves for the movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
of life renews itself, while the mould or form remains." You may
even affirm, without appearing too adventurous, that the innumerable
whirling globules which enter into the composition of the human blood
are so many microscopical individuals, each with its own proper
life,&mdash;infinitesimal forms which are born, and move to and fro, and
disappear, and are renewed, without the individual&mdash;whose aggregate
they perform&mdash;having any consciousness of all this activity.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the collective integral being which we call humanity,
lives and is developed through the removal of the individuals composing
it,&mdash;ephemeral creatures, each of whom thinks himself a god!</p>

<p>Must we stop there? That would be to declare humanity the last term
of a progression whose commencement and end, according to our own
acknowledgment, completely escape us: it would be at once a contradiction
and a flagrant violation of the great law of infinite continuity which
reigns everywhere.</p>


<p class="p1a">To suppose that beyond humanity there is only nothingness,
would be to enunciate an hypothesis as puerile as that which pretended
the earth was not only the centre of our system, but the sole inhabited
or inhabitable point in the immensity of space, and that the stars of the
firmament were created for the service and pleasure of mortals. Suppose
that this absurd belief were true; of what use, I ask you, would be all
our agitations, all our flutterings, all our conceptions, all our
conquests, all our glories, all our memories, when the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
the world would sweep away and annihilate our race? It was well worth the
trouble, truly, of being born, of living, and of suffering, to terminate,
after all, in so inglorious a fashion!... Adhere to your hypothesis,
materialist, if you have the courage; surely, no man of sense can accept
it!</p>


<p class="p1a">Let us now resume the thread of our meditations.</p>

<p>The end of our system has come at last: the sun, the planets, and
their satellites form but one chaotic igneous mass,&mdash;a brilliant
fugitive luminary, new-born to the inhabitants of worlds which have
escaped intact.</p>

<p>The dust of our extinguished world will not be scattered hap-hazard;
the molecules of matter, indissolubly linked together by universal
gravitation, will so arrange themselves as to constitute a new, and
perhaps a more perfect world. But in the constitution of this new world,
balanced like the old, our human bones, our ashes united with those of
our ancestors, may have, as far as they are matter, their due share. As
for the Thought which makes the true power of humanity, which gives to
man all his value,&mdash;Thought, perfectible and transmissible,&mdash;it
will contribute nothing, because it is absolutely imponderable and
impassible. Will it then be lost for ever?</p>

<p>If the world is to last for ever, you may justly regard as immortal
the indefinite transmission of Thought, and the perpetuity of the
memory of certain great men. But will all this avail, if the world must
perish?</p>

<p>The world will never end, you say; it is eternal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>But how do you know this? If it has had a beginning, as
geology and astronomy prove,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> it will also have an end. This
end, however, will not be an annihilation; it will simply be, as we have
already pointed out, a transformation of matter. As for the problems,
whether nature itself was created, and whether it is eternal, let us
leave them to the discussion of heated theoricians, who are too blind to
perceive that some questions it is wisest neither to affirm nor deny, but
<em>to know how to ignore</em>.</p>


<p class="p1a">The error, then, which we have been considering, destroys
itself through its consequences. Let us admit, in effect, that our
world&mdash;such as it is, just as it is&mdash;will last for ever. In
that case what becomes of the power and travail of humanity? All they
have accomplished are some slight changes of the terrestrial crust,
barely sufficient, here and there, to modify the influences of climate.
A limited number of men labour, it is true, for the progress and full
development of transmissible thought. But even supposing that, in the
course of centuries, humanity succeeds in comprehending, it can only
<em>grow</em> through the development of the faculties of all its members, and
the due balance of all the social forces by means of liberty. Supposing
that reason, united to science and conscience, should finally combine in
one family the various tribes and peoples scattered over the earth's broad
surface; do you indulge yourself in the hope of crossing the limits of the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
organization, and establishing the royalty of man "through
the interpretation and imitation of Nature?"</p>

<p>Do you cherish the idea of penetrating, through the perfect union of
all your intellectual forces, the mysteries of creation?</p>

<p>No; you would never dare to form such a hope, to nourish such an
idea, at least unless you felt that the earth (which you must first
demonstrate) comprehends in itself the whole universe, that the humanity
swarming on its surface is eternal, that every other creature is
absolutely subordinate to it: in a word, that Man is all!</p>

<p>But we know how limited is human power. We are not masters even of
the mechanism of the body; the movements of organic life are independent
of our will; we can neither command the stomach, the lungs, nor the
heart: that marvellous process of absorption and elimination, that
perpetual movement hither or thither which constitutes the essence of
the assimilative function, goes on in us&mdash;as in all living beings,
animal or vegetable&mdash;completely outside our sphere of activity.
Then, without quitting our planet, how numerous are the movements which
still escape the human will!</p>


<p class="p1a">It is quite different when we lift up our eyes to examine
the face of heaven. We have no grasp whatever of the incommensurable
spiraloids of innumerable worlds to which our own belongs; we have no
means of communicating with the inhabitants of other planets; we cannot
establish any interchange of thought with the <em>men</em>
(if there be any) of Mercury, Venus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,&mdash;who form, perhaps, like the <em>men</em>
of the earth, the most elevated circle of material life, varying under
an infinity of forms upon each of their floating domiciles.... I see
you smiling, reader, because you do not believe that these <em>other
earths</em>&mdash;satellites of the sun, like our own&mdash;are inhabited
by beings analagous to our human race. You are at liberty not to believe
it. But then, to be in agreement with yourselves, you ought to declare
in favour of the Science of the Past, though demonstrated to be false,
against the Science of the Present. Will you do so? Certainly not. But
then, of two things, one: either you will be obliged to make the earth
an unique exception, a kind of monstrosity in the midst of the other
mechanism of the universe, which will be to throw yourself back upon
the erroneous science of the ancients; or you must perforce admit that
the earth is not specially privileged, and that the other planets, its
companions, have also their human inhabitants.</p>


<p class="p1a">Is this all? Alas, all this is nothing! The other worlds
whose suns appear to us under the form of scintillating points or stars,
will, undoubtedly, in like manner, possess their systems of planets and
satellites. Why should they divaricate from the general plan of the
universe? Now, multiply the number of the stars&mdash;who has counted
them?&mdash;with the probable number of their planets, and you will gain,
if this be permitted you, the number of <em>humanities</em> who people yonder
star-sown space. And it is not only with <em>these</em> we must be
able to correspond, but with the humanities of all the nebulæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
of all the firmaments&mdash;for remember our starry heaven itself is
but a nebula&mdash;that we must establish an interchange of ideas, if
you would have your power, and civilisation, and intellectual royalty,
something more than a mere optical illusion of your pride.</p>


<p class="p1a">You do not cease to proclaim as an axiom that "there are
no abrupt intervals in Nature;" that Nature never ventures upon sudden
leaps or bounds ("in natura non datur saltus"), and yet you would make
an exception for the world of thought&mdash;a world which no more lies
outside the laws of nature than does the physical world. The former
ought even to secure our preference; it is there only that we are free,
that we can become true creators, by creating for ourselves our own
happiness; that we can grow great before our own eyes, by following,
not the tyrannous will of the <em>brute</em>, but the tender voice of the
<em>angel</em>; by listening to conscience&mdash;that pure and infallible
counsellor&mdash;conscience, the foundation of all justice, the latent
force of generations passing away and coming, the universal gravitation
of our species as of all the ultra-terrestrial humanities.</p>


<p class="p1a">But how can the humanities, with which we suppose
the universe to be peopled,&mdash;how can they communicate with one
another?</p>

<p>The law of attraction comprehends not only the celestial bodies, but
also their intervals, the intersidereal spaces. Do these spaces present
a void to the thinking beings who probably people the stars?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything, force and matter, testifies to an entire unity of plan
or thought, and the mind which is powerful enough to rise above all the
attractions and influences of the body, the mind which, by its continuous
labour, alone renders life and man of any importance, the mind once
detached from the animal nature which it drags behind it like a prisoner
to the chariot of his conqueror, shall it be inferior to inert matter?
shall it be less than a ship without its compass? Continuous here, shall
that continuity be elsewhere broken up? Surely this is impossible.</p>


<p class="p1a">But how are we to recognise this continuity of essence in
a spirit which, like man's, appears unavoidably fixed, like a parasite,
to the surface of a planet?</p>

<p>Here lies the whole difficulty of the question; a question all
the more perplexing because, in the search after scientific truth,
the mind walks surely and steadily, except when resting upon the
senses,&mdash;which are the backbone, so to speak, of the experimental
method.</p>

<p>Answers, indeed, are not wanting, for each religion has its own.
Every creed attempts to solve the problem. But then, faith is required
to accept the answer or solution, and alas! faith is not implanted in
every soul. It is useless, therefore, to wish that it might be the gift
of those who, to the authority of tradition and long-established dogmas,
prefer the liberty of discussion and the axioms of science. Are our
bigots actually aware of what they do when they seek to compel into their
circle of belief those minds which tend to escape from it at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
tangent? We assert that in so doing they are guilty of an act of
iniquity, of a veritable blasphemy.</p>


<p class="p1a">Some explanation is necessary here. You believe, we hope,
in the majesty, power, wisdom, and mercy of God, in the revelations
He has vouchsafed to man, in the immortality of the soul. These are
great problems, however; the greatest problems a mortal can venture
to discuss. Already I see the bigot frowning; he professes to be
shocked by the word "problem," he would fain substitute for it that of
"certainty" or "truth." Well, through faith we accept them as truths;
but, metaphysically speaking, they may be regarded as problems which the
All-wise has submitted to man's earnest consideration. In fact, the God
in whom you and we believe, in whom you and we put all our trust, has
surrounded them with something of uncertainty, has invested them with so
much of doubtfulness as may test our faith.</p>

<p>Yes, in doing so, He has had a purpose to fulfil. Let us think of a
geometrician&mdash;and an ancient writer said that God, by creating the
world, created geometry&mdash;for the sake of exercising the minds of his
pupils, his children, giving them a problem to be solved.</p>

<p>If at the same time, he placed before them the solution, he would
assuredly fail in his object. No means would remain of distinguishing the
capable from the incapable, the studious from the indifferent, the idler
from the worker, if they all found the question answered beforehand!</p>

<p>True, if the problem is too difficult, if the solution lies beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
the faculties of those whom he wishes to test and put to the proof, the
master will not fail to furnish them with all the elements necessary for
their guidance, whether they consider it from without, or whether they
consider it with the help of their own inner consciousness.</p>

<p>But science and conscience stand in need of an equally difficult task;
the first, that it may learn to observe clearly, the latter that it may
learn to act purely. And it is here, above all, that the two-fold nature
of man becomes a perplexity and a stumbling-block. On the one hand, man
creates theories, in order to disembarrass himself of the science which
calls for the exercise of powerful and laborious observation; on the
other, he creates dogmas, which he hopes may lull to sleep that ever
active, ever restless conscience, which demands fertile and beneficial
actions, and rejects barren or deceitful phrases.</p>

<p>It is true that to many minds the discussion of the questions at which
we have hinted seems a sorry work, because the time given for their
discussion is necessarily so limited. What is life? they say. What can be
effected in so short an interval? What can man hope to accomplish in the
few short years that intervene between manhood, when the mind is mature,
and old age, when the intellect grows enfeebled? These are the men who
echo the old poet's mournful cry:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>But the poet, while taking this despondent view of life,
forgets&mdash;not only that it is an opportunity, but&mdash;that it is the
first stage of an eternal existence, and that the progress begun
now shall be continued hereafter, when the mind, freed from
its material clogs, shall enter upon the full fruition of its
wondrous powers. And however brief it may be, is it not
better it should be devoted to noble work than to ignoble
idleness? Is it not better to use it as a time of preparation
than to waste it in empty pleasures? To the despairing wail
of the poet just quoted we would oppose, as far worthier of a
gallant spirit, Ben Jonson's admirable conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Let us beware, however, when we devote our life to the pursuit
of wisdom, that we do not make a false start. Do not let us diverge
into the narrow way of bigotry and dogma. It is the property of
exclusive and intolerant error to dominate and to reign alone. For
this reason we systematically refuse and reject all control; and it is
thus men have been fatally led to lay a rash hand upon intellectual
liberty,&mdash;liberty, which the All-wise Himself has refrained from
touching! Such is the early taint of our race, the moral situation of
humanity.</p>

<p>But retribution has followed close upon this violation of all
that is most sacred in our human world. The schools of philosophy,
and the infallible creeds, founded upon authority to the exclusion
of all mental and spiritual freedom, have never ceased to be at war
with one another, and instead of labouring for that union which is
strength,&mdash;that union so necessary to the happiness and advancement
of humanity,&mdash;they have everywhere sown irreconcilable antipathies
and bloody discords. Such is the religion of those who, under a pretence
of worshipping God, worship only themselves! History affords us abundant
illustrations of this melancholy truth.</p>

<p>Finally, let us return to our metamorphosis. The butterfly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
which the Greeks designated by the same word as the soul,
&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;, springs, like every living creature, from an egg. But see
what a transformation this egg undergoes! It becomes a
caterpillar&mdash;a transitory form of animal life, remarkable for its
voracity; this caterpillar is in its turn transformed; it grows into a
chrysalis,&mdash;a temporary tomb, and whence issues the winged insect,
alone adapted to the discharge of all the functions of a perfect animal.
Gluttonous and greedy of enjoyment, the caterpillar lived for itself.
So the caterpillar has no sex; while the butterfly hovers from flower
to flower, has to seek therein its own nourishment, there to find the
companion with whom its being is to be united.</p>


<p class="p1a">This metamorphosis impresses the observer; principally
because its periods are so distinct, and are so plainly marked by
stages, which have all the appearance of veritable species. But he
would greatly err if he thought it confined to a certain class of
insects. All insects,&mdash;nay, more, all animals, including man
himself,&mdash;undergo certain transformations in the course of their
lives. Metamorphosis plays an important part in the unity of the general
scheme of Creative Thought. If it is not always recognised, the reason
is, that its phases are not boldly marked, that the periods blend into
one another, that the various stages are effaced in the continuousness of
the transformation.</p>


<p class="p1a">But let not this continuity prevent the observer from detecting
or discerning <em>in that which is, that which is to come</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
In the caterpillar he must learn to see the chrysalis; in the chrysalis
he must be ready to recognise the future butterfly. And in all these
changes the thoughtful mind may acknowledge a significant emblem of that
immortality of the soul, that final transformation of humanity, which the
Word of God has promised to us:&mdash;</p>

<p>To assure ourselves by observation that, in living matter, there
are organs irrevocably destined to decay or disappear, while others
incline and grow towards perfection, is certainly one of the noblest
studies imaginable. If philosophers, instead of employing their time in
profitless speculations, devoted themselves to the examination of the
great Book of Nature, God's second revelation, they would long ago have
discovered what they are still seeking.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: avoid;">APPENDIX.</h2>

<p class="centre">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;◇&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Solar Eclipse of 1870.</span></p>

<p>The total Solar Eclipse, which is to render famous the month of
December in the present year&mdash;famous, that is, in astronomical
annals&mdash;deserves, we think, some special notice in our pages. In
1860, the <em>Himalaya</em> was fitted out by Government for the use of
the <em>savants</em> desirous of observing the Solar Eclipse visible
that year in Spain, and the results of the expedition were so important
as fully to warrant the liberality of the Government. The eclipse of
the present year will also be visible in Spain, but the path of the
sun's shadow will pass as far north as Cape Spartel, and, crossing
Algeria, will go northwards, <em>via</em> Sicily, and in the direction
of Constantinople. The totality of the eclipse will not last so long as
that of the Indian eclipse in 1868. The sun will be hidden from sight
for no longer period than about two minutes twelve seconds, and whatever
observations our astronomers are anxious to make must be made in that
brief interval. It may not unreasonably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
be suggested that, in so short a time, no data can be ascertained worth
the cost and trouble the proposed expedition will necessitate; but the
reader requires to be informed that the most valuable acquisitions lately
won in the region of solar physics have been the result of observations
which may almost be described as momentary.</p>

<p>What, then, is the important point on which our astronomers hope to
gain information from a close examination of the approaching eclipse?</p>

<p>This question has been ably answered by a well-informed writer in
the <cite>Daily News</cite>. The great problem to be solved is that of the strange
appearance of the solar corona; of that glory of light which rings round
the great luminary when totally eclipsed, to it, as some astronomers
assert, a purely optical phenomenon, or, as others more reasonably
declare, "one of the most imposing of all the features of the solar
system." It is true that the former opinion is held by such men as Faye,
Lockyer, and Professor Airy; but if it be founded on fact, the phenomenon
loses all its importance, and nearly all its interest. If the other
opinion prove correct, and the corona is discovered to be in reality
an appendage of the orb of day, then the mind must at once acknowledge
its unsurpassed splendour, its magnificent proportions. As its glow and
ethereal radiancy often extends several degrees from the eclipsed sun,
its diameter cannot be less than 2,800,000 miles.</p>

<p>Assume, then, that it is shaped like a globe, that it is the
globular envelope (so to speak) of the sun, and we may conclude
that its outer boundary would at most enclose a volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
twenty-seven times as large as the sun's, or, in other words,
<em>twenty-seven million times</em> larger than our terrestrial world.</p>

<p>It is in reference to this magnificent phenomenon that we hope to
obtain some satisfactory information in December 1870. The results
ascertained from the eclipse of 1868 proved to be almost directly
contradictory to those obtained last year in the United States, and the
problem now is, to discover <em>why</em> these results were contradictory.</p>

<p>In the meantime,&mdash;observes the writer already quoted,&mdash;some
astronomers say that the observations already made suffice to show the
real nature of the solar corona. "It has frequently happened that,
with the means of solving a problem ready at their hands, astronomers
have been content rather to wait till new observations removed their
doubts, than to undertake the work of carefully analysing the facts
already discovered. It is urged that the atmospheric explanation (Faye's
and Lockyer's) is opposed by simple optical considerations; that the
blackness of the moon's disc, in the very heart of the corona, affords
the most unmistakable evidence that the moon lies nearer to us than the
corona." The solar glare which, according to Faye's theory, illuminates
our atmosphere, ought, according to this view&mdash;and ordinary
reasoners will think this argument irrefragable&mdash;to cover the lunar
disc as well as the surrounding heavens.</p>

<p>It is also argued, very forcibly, that the active atmosphere
above the horizon of the observer is partially obscured during
total eclipse, while all that part lying in the direction in which
the corona is seen is wholly shielded from the direct rays of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
the sun, and cannot, therefore, furnish the "atmospheric
glare" on which M. Faye relies.</p>

<p>M. Faye's theory is powerfully combated in a paper read
by Mr Proctor before the Royal Astronomical Society, and a
summary of which appeared in "Nature."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>He remarked that if we in reality possess sufficient evidence to
determine whether the corona is or is not a solar appendage, it would
be unfortunate for, and in some sense a discredit to science, if the
precious seconds available for observers in December next were wasted
upon observations directed to such a point determinable beforehand.</p>

<p>He proceeded to express his belief that the corona was no terrestrial
phenomenon, arguing that the very blackness of the moon as compared with
the corona (to which we have already referred), shows that the coronal
splendour is <em>behind</em> the moon. In fact, the moon is projected on the
corona as on a background; whereas, if the light be due to atmospheric
glare, the corona ought to be a foreground.</p>

<p>This argument, however, may fail on the ground of its very simplicity.
Mr Proctor, therefore, proceeded to inquire whether air which lies
between the observer and the corona is really illuminated. He pointed
out that all round the sun, for many degrees, perfect darkness should
prevail if the illumination of the atmosphere by direct solar light were
in question. As to the atmospheric glare caused by the coloured flames
and prominences of the sun's disc, it must be comparatively
small, bearing no higher proportion to the actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
light of the atmosphere than ordinary atmospheric glare bears
to actual sunlight,&mdash;a very small proportion indeed.</p>

<p>But a fatal objection to the theory that the corona is due either to
the glare from the prominences or to light reflected from the surrounding
air, consisted in the fact that the so-called glare ought to cover the
moon's disc.</p>

<p>Mr Proctor next referred to a number of observations in support
of the view that the coronal light is not terrestrial; such as the
appearance of glare during partial eclipses, the glare always trenching
on the lunar disc; the relatively greater darkness of the central part of
the lunar disc in annular eclipses; the visibility of that part of the
lunar disc which lies beyond the sun in partial eclipses, the limb being
seen dark on the background of the sky; and the visibility of the corona
in partial eclipses;&mdash;were its most distinctive peculiarities,
having been recognised when the sun's face is not wholly covered.</p>

<p>What, then, <em>is</em> the actual nature of the corona?</p>

<p>May it not consist of the denser parts of meteoric systems travelling
round the sun?</p>

<p>Leverrier has shown, and Mr Buxendell has helped to show, that the
motion of Mercury's perihelion indicates the presence of a ring of bodies
in the vicinity of the sun; but we have good reason for believing that
for each meteor system our earth encounters, there must be millions on
millions whose perihelia lie within the earth's orbit. Since the earth
meets with fifty-six such systems, it will be seen how enormous probably
is the total number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>Is, then, the corona simply the projection of these systems,
illuminated as they must be by an intensity of solar light exceeding
many hundred-fold that which illumines our summer days, nay, in certain
places, were raised by his heat to a state of incandescence?</p>


<p class="p1a">Such are some of the questions which, it is hoped, the
eclipse of December 1870 will help to solve; and we think our readers
will admit that their importance justifies us in looking forward to
the approaching phenomenon with anxious curiosity. The bounds of human
knowledge are gradually enlarging; and as they enlarge, they do but more
vividly illustrate the infinite wisdom and perfectness of the scheme of
creation.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Coloured Stars.</span></p>

<p>Before bringing these pages to a close, and appending to our
description of Everyday Objects (everyday, but not commonplace) the word
"Finis," we wish to direct the reader's attention to the subject of
coloured stars; not because these beautiful spheres can be fairly classed
under our general title, but because they serve to show the peculiar
attractiveness and novelty of scientific inquiry, and the wonderful
results that spring from the persevering study of God's universe.</p>

<p>To the eye of the ordinary observer, one star seems much like another;
these "lamps of night" differ, indeed, in brilliancy, in their distance
from the earth, in their relative magnitudes; but to all appearance they exhibit a complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
identity in physical constitution, and their white light has
furnished poetry with one of its commonest images.</p>

<p>But the astronomer, armed with his wonder-revealing glass, has
discovered that innumerable stars are exquisitely coloured; that some
are blue, and others green, and others red. If on a clear night you
examine Perseus with your telescope, you will find that the star Eta is
of a glowing red. In the system of Ophiuchus you will encounter a blue
star; in that of Draco, a deep red star; Taurus has a large red and a
small bluish star; and in Argo, a blue sun is attended by a dark-red
satellite.</p>

<p>The stars occur in double, triple, or multiple groups or clusters;
and the systems so constituted differ from what we presumptuously call
<em>the</em> Solar System in their colouring; and in this variety or diversity,
yet another variety is visible. The binary coloured systems are not all
composed of blue and red suns. In that of Gamma Andromedæ the great
central orb is of an orange hue, the moon revolving round it green as
emerald. What results from the marriage of these two colours&mdash;from
this union of orange and emerald? Do we not see in it, says a French astronomer,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
a combination, if the phrase is allowable, full of youth (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">assortiment
plein de jeunesse</i>)&mdash;a grand, a magnificent orange-coloured sun in
the midst of the firmament&mdash;next to it, a resplendent emerald, which
interweaves with the gold its greenish gleams?</p>

<p>The following lively picture is borrowed from the graphic pages of M.
Flammarion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>There is more variety, he says, in the innumerable star-systems
which crowd the fields of space, than in all the changes which the most
skilful opticians can project on the screen of a magic lantern. Some of
the planetary universes lighted up by two suns display the entire gamut
of colours above blue, but are without the sparkling tints of gold and
purple which contribute so greatly to the luminosity of our world.</p>

<p>In this category may be placed certain systems situated in the
constellations of Andromedæ, the Serpent, Ophiuchus, and Coma
Berenices.</p>

<p>Others are illuminated by red suns, as, for example, a double star in
Leo.</p>

<p>Others, again, are wholly dominated by blue and yellow, or, at least,
are kindled by a blue sun and a yellow sun, which afford but a limited
series of the tints or shades comprised in the combinations of these
primitive colours; such are the systems of Ceta, Eridanus (where one is
straw-coloured, the other blue), Cameleopardalis, Orion, Rhinoceros,
Gemini, Boötes (where the greater one is yellow, and the lesser a
greenish blue), and Cygnus (where the smaller is "blue as a sapphire").
On the other hand, combinations of red and green may be found in
Cassiopeia, Coma Berenices, and Hercules.</p>


<p class="p1a">There are other stellar systems which, according to
Flammarion, more nearly approximate to our own, in the sense that one of
the suns illuminating them has, like ours, a white
light,&mdash;the source of all colours,&mdash;while its neighbouring luminary
casts a permanent reflection upon everything. Such, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
instance, are the worlds revolving round the great sun of Alpha, in
Aries; this great sun is white, but a smaller sun is constantly visible
in the sky, whose azure reflections cover as with "a diaphanous veil" the
various objects exposed to its rays. Number 26 in Ceta presents the same
conditions, which are those, too, of a great number of the most brilliant
stars. In the case of the worlds gravitating round the principal world of
these binary systems, the originative white lustre would appear to create
the infinite varieties noticeable upon the earth, with the distinction,
of course, that an azure gleam constantly issues from the other sun; but
for the planets gravitating round the latter, the predominant colouring
will be blue, tempered by the action of the remoter white sun.</p>

<p>And just as white suns have blue suns for their companions, so
have red suns yellow, or <em>vice versâ</em>. What a strange and curious
radiance&mdash;like that of "a dome of many-coloured glass"&mdash;must
be shed upon a planet by its red and green or yellow and blue suns!
What striking contrasts, what fairylike changes, must be produced by
a red day and a green day succeeding alternately to a white day, or a
day of darkness! Why do not our poets take up such a theme as this? Can
they find aught more remarkable or more eëry in the dreams of their
imagination?</p>

<p>Supposing that these wonderful spheres are surrounded, like Jupiter or
Saturn, by a ring of satellites, what can be their aspect when lit up by
several suns, each sun a source of different-coloured light?</p>

<p>This one, we may imagine, will be divided into hemispheres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
red and blue, that will suspend in the firmament a crescent of gold;
another will seem to drop from the azure circle like a gorgeous
cluster of emerald fruit. Ruby moons, opaline moons, moons of jasper
and amethyst,&mdash;all shining with a mystic and indescribable
radiance,&mdash;surely the heavens are decked with jewels like an Eastern
queen!</p>

<p>Our poets may chant the praises of our modest, simple nights, of our
calm, hushed heavens, bright only with the beauty of the silver moon,
which pours its pale lustre with a winning charm on town and tree, on
wood and lake. They may sing, as Barry Cornwall sings&mdash;</p>

<p>In some such ecstatic strains as this we may laud our moonlit nights,
acknowledging in our heart of hearts the power of their silent, subtle
loveliness; but how shall we compare them with nights made wonderful by
a blending of golden and emerald fires? by the shifting coruscations of
stars of many colours?</p>

<p>But here we must conclude a dissertation which threatens to become
a rhapsody. It is difficult, however, to treat of such a theme, and to
follow up all its strange and startling suggestions, in sober prose.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Alpine Flora.</span></p>

<p>The Alpine Flora, of which in a preceding section we have
given a very imperfect sketch, has been examined with loving
minuteness by Messrs Elijah Walton and T. G. Bonney; and
other united results of pen and pencil have been placed before
the public in a handsome volume entitled "Flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
from the Upper Alps, with Glimpses of their Homes." A somewhat similar
subject has been treated with much delicacy of feeling and fervour
of description by the Rev. Hugh Macmillan, in his "Holidays in High
Lands."</p>

<p>Among the Alpine plants sketched and described by Messrs Walton
and Bonney are the beautiful <em>Lychnis</em>, a close relative of our
corn-cockle and garden pink, and so called, says Gerard, the quaint
old botanist, because it is a "light-giving flower." He also met with
immense breadths of violet <em>pansies</em>,&mdash;"that's for thoughts,"
says Ophelia,&mdash;covering the sloping pasture-grounds of the Col
d'Autune, and blending with rose and star gentians, soldanellas,
primulas, and anemones. The pink blossoms and bare stem of the <em>house
leek</em> is found "among the blocks tumbled down from the ice-streams,
and its sparkling clusters seem to glow with a richer hue on the stony
ruin which has shattered the pine, and crushed the life even out of the
rhododendron."</p>

<p>In the Glarus Alps the odorous crimson tufts of the <em>Kammblume</em>
are discovered in a profusion which rejoices and astonishes the
traveller. The yellow-blossomed <em>ragwort</em> spreads its stem over the
rugged mountain-sides in every Alpine district. But next in fame
and beauty to the gentians,&mdash;which is, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>, the
mountain-flower,&mdash;must be placed the <em>edelwein</em>, celebrated by
Kobele and other famous poets, and growing in almost every part of the
Alps from Dauphiné to the Dolomites.</p>

<p>For further details respecting a most interesting branch of
botany, we refer the reader to the two works already named,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
and he will find that the barrenest, stoniest slope of the Alpine rocks,
the bleak recesses where the ice river has its origin, and the rugged
ledge where the pitiless winds seem to expend their wildest fury, have
their objects of grace and beauty,&mdash;their gentle and ever-welcome
evidence of the Divine love, the Divine wisdom, and the Divine power,
as exercised for the delight of man in the remotest wildernesses of the
earth. The love of God is everywhere.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Its purpose is to tell both young and old, but especially the former,
how much of interest there is in everything connected with nature, its
resources and productions during the progress of the year, and how,
month after month, animals, insects, trees, shrubs, flowers, and even
weeds have their several functions to fill, and the manner of their doing
so.... The illustrations, which are numerous, greatly increase the
value of the volume."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Observer.</p>

<blockquote><p>"<cite>The Circle of the Year</cite> is essentially a book for the country. The
townsman may indeed read it to profit, but it will assuredly raise within
him a hankering to be out in the fields, wandering along the green lanes
among the trailing hedge-flowers, or attempting to realize the curious fact
that a lily of the valley is first cousin to an asparagus."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Berwick Warder.</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is a healthy and vigorous work, which none can fail to profit from."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Border Advertiser.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The book is therefore really what it professes to be, a picture of the
seasons, and very beautiful and engaging, many of the pictures being
drawn in fine sympathy with the outward beauty, and in harmony with the
inward spirit lying not deeply under all God's beautiful works. The book
is laden with fine thoughts and pleasing observation, and is a handsome
and valuable volume for the young."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Perth Advertiser.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr Adams has done his work well.... We might liken him to the
master of a panorama, only his figures are of the sublimest order&mdash;such
as, the procession of the seasons on the earth, and the corresponding
procession of the constellations in the heavens."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"The book will be found indeed a very pleasant and instructive one."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Edinburgh Courant.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Its aim is to teach the unscientific observer how to make use of his eye,&mdash;'how
to look, and what to look at;' and to show him how much of
wonder and beauty lies everywhere around him, if he could only recognise
it."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Scotsman.</p>

<blockquote><p>"<cite>The Circle of the Year</cite> is a superior class of gift-book.... It is a
loving and laborious exposition of a great variety of natural phenomena,
as they may be observed in the course of the year by the student of natural
history, written in such a pleasing style, and adorned with so many illustrations,
literary and familiar, that the thoughtful youth who once commences
its perusal, is certain to be carried by it through the whole cycle of the
seasons."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Queen.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The work is replete with interesting observation; legends connected
with the subjects treated upon are introduced, and the pages are interspersed
with many excellent illustrations."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"The book is charmingly got up in all respects, with good letterpress
and abundance of illustrations."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Kelso Mail.</p>

<blockquote><p>"In a number of daily walks, a vast amount of curious and instructive
information is imparted to the reader, who cannot leave these studies of
nature without being wiser, and perhaps better than he was before. The
illustrations are numerous and excellent, the typography beautiful, and the
binding elegant."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Aberdeen Journal.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The book is founded on a French work, <cite>Les Saisons</cite>, and the object of
author and editor is to teach the unscientific observer how to make use of
his eyes&mdash;<em>how</em> to look, and <em>what</em> to look at. The book is written in a
popular style, befitting its pretensions, and numerous woodcuts illustrate
the text, while poetry is freely used with effect."</p></blockquote>

of the men who fought and wrote and meditated under
Elizabeth, that we owe the brightest glories of our literature, the
rise and permanence of our power, the world-wide expansion of our
commerce, and, as a consequence, our national wealth, which is
'power.'"</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Dumfries Herald.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The biographies of these men, compiled from the best sources,
are given in a lively and interesting style, and nothing, we fancy,
could be more welcome to the youthful readers, for whom the
volume is principally designed, than the gift of such a book."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Athenæum.</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the lives of Raleigh and Hawkins, Gilbert, Cavendish,
Drake, Philip Sydney, and Shakespeare, a portion of the heroism
and intellect of the Elizabethan period is here illustrated.... The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a></span>
purpose is so good, and the work so honestly done, that we cannot
but warmly commend both. A more wholesome book for young
readers we have seldom seen. It is one, moreover, in which faded
memories may dip and be refreshed."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"The author has bestowed much care in the compilation of the
volume, the best sources of information only having been chosen."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The Inverness Courier.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The whole breathes a healthy, manly, patriotic spirit, which
every one must wish to see fostered among the youth of this utilitarian
age. The volume is beautifully printed and illustrated."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">The London Scotsman.</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the plain but comparatively accurate record of the deeds of
these 'brave men of old' which Mr Adams has furnished, there can
be no doubt that he has done much to add to the information of
his older and to stimulate the patriotism of his younger readers."</p></blockquote>

plane of the orbit,&mdash;the semi-major axis of the ellipse, or the mean distance
of the planet from the sun,&mdash;the eccentricity of the ellipse, or the
relation between the distance which separates the forces from the centre
and the semi-major axis assumed to be unity,&mdash;and the movements of the
perihelions and the nodes. These elements change with extreme slowness.
Thus, the inclination of Jupiter diminishes by 8" in a century; and that of
Saturn increases by 9"; but the very ecliptic varies,&mdash;it diminishes 33" in
a century.</p>

<p>The variations of the eccentricities are scarcely computable by centuries;
their effect is, that the ellipses insensibly approach or recede from a circular
form.</p>

<p>It is demonstrated by mathematical analysis that these variations are
periodical, and confined within narrow limits, in such wise that "the
planetary system can oscillate only round a certain mean, from which it
never departs except by a very small quantity." But may not this very
mean, which we have taken to be constant, oscillate round a more distant
and still more constant mean?</p>

<p>Observation had long ago detected a continual acceleration in the
movement of Jupiter, and a not less certain diminution in the movement
of Saturn. Now, to say of a star that its velocity augments, is to declare
that it draws nearer its centre of movement. To say that its velocity decreases,
is to affirm that it is retiring from that centre.</p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, that Jupiter,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> the greatest of our planets, is
destined to be swallowed up, or absorbed, in the incandescent mass of the
Sun, while Saturn,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> with its belt and eight satellites, will gradually wander
further and further into the mysterious infinity of space. It is true enough
that these catastrophes are very distant,&mdash;distant to a period of time which
the human imagination cannot even grasp,&mdash;and the "common herd" will
certainly feel no anxious apprehension about an event which will not take
place until myriads of years have elapsed.</p>

<p>Yet, in the last century, the question excited the curiosity of certain
scientific societies, and they directed the attention of the geometers to
these formidable perturbations. Euler and Lagrange spent their keen intellects
upon them to no profit. Laplace discovered that between the mean
velocities of Jupiter and Saturn the ratios are simple, and capable of calculation;
five times the velocity of Saturn perceptibly equals ten times the
velocity of Jupiter. These terms, which, in the regularly-decreasing and
indefinite series, might have been neglected, have acquired a value which
was worthy of being taken into consideration. From thence result, in the
movements of the two planets, those perturbations whose complete development
necessitates a period of upwards of nine hundred years.... This
will be, then, another periodic inequality.</p>

<p>But, independently of the centres, which we suppose to be in themselves
variable, may there not exist, in the space traversed by our planet, some
cause of perturbation? Is our system so isolated in the universe that it
neither receives nor loses aught of that which constitutes its force and matter?
Is there no solidarity between its different worlds? And if this solidarity
exists, is not their transformation a necessity?</p></div>
